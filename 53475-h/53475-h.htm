<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear Mr. Symonds</span>,—<em>I send you a little book; different
from the many volumes, plump with documents and the dignity
of History, which I intended for you long ago. But, since I have
no better thing to offer, take—dear Master—these rough and
scattered pages. For to whom, if not to you, should I dedicate
the book? When I look back, I see you at my side in all my
studies; for the last ten years, there is not one of them which
has not been confided to you, and, most of all, my dreams of
History. So that whatever I write belongs in some sort to
you; but especially this little volume of which we talked so
much in your study at Davos two years ago. Do you remember
how you guided me through the innumerable pages of
Litta and of Muratori in quest of the secret of the French
Claim to Milan? We did not find much of that, but we found
so many better things; and, best of all, the happy hours which
you illuminated! Hours in which you evoked for me, as we
plunged deeper and deeper into your Chronicles, the great
figures of the Past. At first they rose before me, pale and
mute—silent and immaculate as the white recesses of your
Alps; but, at the touch of your wand, they assumed their
ancient colour and consistence—the very smile, the gait, the
accent, the passions, that had moved them once beneath this
sun that has survived them; their voices magically issued out
of the silent yellow pages; the sound of their battles clashed
anew along your windless valleys and eagle-haunted mountain
tops. And, once alive, they remained alive for me.</em></p>

<p class='c006'><em>As I sat and wondered, a new desire awoke in me, an eager
wish to seize these brilliant apparitions, to strip them of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>faded purple, to strip them of their form and colour, to lay
them bare to their innermost tissue and catch the reason and the
secret of their being.</em></p>

<p class='c006'><em>And, first of all, to understand exactly what they did, and
when, and why. Our beautiful chronicles were not always
quite precise. I began to see that what I wanted must be
sought in manuscripts and foreign archives. And, half afraid,
<a id='corriv.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title=' told'>I told</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_iv.8'><ins class='correction' title=' told'>I told</ins></a></span> you of my project for exchanging a cheerful holiday in
Switzerland against a week or two of dull research in Paris.
Since then I have worked long and hard, in Paris, in London,
in Florence, and the writing of dead hands has grown
familiar to me; but I have never forgotten that it was first in
the solitude of your lofty valley, that my task grew plain before
my mind. And now to whom, if not to you should I offer
these scattered ruins of the thing undone—these first ineffectual
sketches of that</em> History of the French in Italy, <em>which still I
mean to write? From Davos they took their flight; let them
seek the nest again!</em></p>

<p class='c006'><em>If I had better profited by your lessons and your example, it
would not have been a mere sheaf of fragments that I should
have offered you to-day, but a Book, a solid and coherent whole
consistently animated, in all the complexity and the unity of
its subject, by an epoch, an idea, a man, or an event. Nothing
else is really durable, permanently useful. It is true that I have
tried (and may the candour of this avowal excuse its weakness!)—yes,
I have tried, after the manner of essayists, to give
an apparent unity to my fragments by means of a title, large
and comfortable as the cloak of charity which covers in its
vague expanse a host of strangers.</em></p>

<p class='c006'><em>For, after all, what has Schwester Katrei to do with Charles
VIII., or Isotta of Rimini with Mechtild of Magdeburg?
Shall I avow that the volume is really the fragmentary
essays towards two unwritten histories—one of the house of
Hohenstaufen, the other of the French in Italy? Also I can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>imagine you remarking that, from the thirteenth century to
the sixteenth, my Middle Ages take long a-dying:</em></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<em>Les gens que vous tuez se portent assez bien.</em>”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><em>And you might add that in a book on the end of the Middle
Ages, it is strange to find not a line on the Loss of Constantinople,
and not a chapter on the invention of Printing or the
Discovery of America.</em></p>

<p class='c006'><em>What can I do but acknowledge my incompleteness? Nay,
I will even confess to you that I have my private doubts
whether the Middle Ages are over yet—whether any period
comes to an end at a given epoch, but does not rather still subsist,
diminished yet puissant, stealing in unnoticed currents
along the vast veins and secret fabric of the world. In many a
turn of thought and habit, in many a disregarded constitution—in
May Day and Manor Court, in the Land laws and the Judenhetze—the
Middle Ages are not over yet. Here and there they
reappear and startle us in unexpected corners. That form of
Nature which we know as History is, like every other evolution
of Nature, too complex to be accurately fixed in words. Words
only give the vague surroundings; they are the ill-fitting,
ready-made clothes of a thought.</em></p>

<p class='c006'><em>Therefore, despite their official end, we may doubt whether
we be done with the Middle Ages. And yet you will agree with
me that the personages of my essays belong no longer wholly
to the age in which they lived. Something came to an end
then; something slowly began. Race of Cain and race of
Abel, mystics lost in ecstasy, or captains of prey and plunder,—yet
Eckhart, the forerunner of Hegel, and the sinister
Giangaleazzo dreaming in a different fashion the dream of
Count Cavour, was each unconsciously a precursor of the
Modern Age.</em></p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c006'><em>The Beguines, bringing the dissolvent of mysticism to the
authority of Rome; the Pope, in quitting his true capital for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>Avignon; the Cardinals by opening the Schism: these, between
them, have invented the Reformation....  Giangaleazzo
Visconti, when he made his daughter of Orleans his heir,
prepared the battles of Marignano and Pavia, and condemned
Francis I. to his captivity in Spain. Even as the Feud of
Orleans and Burgundy began the long rivalry of Francis and
the Emperor, the great descendants of those angry houses....
Meanwhile the numerous invasions of Italy under the Dukes of
Orleans, and still later, the triumphal journey of Charles
VIII., brought back to France the splendour of the Renaissance.
Thus Hallam closes the Middle Ages with the taking of
Naples, in 1494. However this be, if you are indulgent,
dear Master, you may consider my essays a very humble and
inadequate Introduction to the study of your Sixteenth Century.</em></p>

<p class='c006'><em>Perhaps I am the only reader who will have learned anything
from the little book. And, after all, I am contented that
it should be so. It is so much pleasanter to learn than to
instruct; and in learning one meets with so many friends and
helpers. I cannot tell you here of all who have befriended
me, but I must at least mention to you the names of Canon
Creighton, unfailing critic and sympathizer; of Mr. Bryce,
who reached out an experienced hand to me and spared me
several more mistakes in Feudal Law; of Mr. H.F. Brown of
Venice, who procured me my Venetian transcripts; of Professor
Villari and Professor Paoli of Florence (it was the latter who
taught me Palæography); and of Comte Albert de Circourt of
Paris, in whom I have found a quite invaluable adviser and
correspondent,—for probably no historian in Europe is so
familiar with the Lombard schemes of Louis d’Orléans as he.</em></p>

<p class='c016'>With the approach of the thirteenth century, the
world awoke from its long and dreamless sleep. Then
began the age of faith, the miraculous century,
starving for lack of bread and nourished upon
heavenly roses. St. Louis and St. Elizabeth,
Dominic the eloquent and the fiery Bonaventura,
Thomas Aquinas and Francis the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>glorioso poverello di
Dio</em></span>, proclaim the enthusiastic spirit of the age. It
is an age of chivalry no less in religion than in love,
an age whose somewhat strained and mystical conception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>of virtue is sweetened by a new strong impulse
of human pity. The world begins to see; and
the green growth of the earth, the birds of the air,
the fishes of the sea, become clear and noticeable
things in the eyes of the saints. The world awakes
and feels. Jean de Matha and Félix de Valois,
gentlemen of Meaux, visit the prisons of France, and
redeem many hundred captives from Morocco. On
all sides men begin to love the sick, the poor, the
sinful; even to long for sickness and poverty, as if
in themselves they were virtuous; even to wonder
whether sin and evil may not be a holy means for
mortifying spiritual pride. To rescue the captive, to
feed the hungry, to nurse the leper, as unawares
Elizabeth of Hungary tended Christ in her Thuringian
city—this is the new ideal of mankind. And
this age of feeling is no less an age of speculation,
of metaphysical inquiry, of manifold heresies and
schisms. No new Bernard stops with his earnest
dogma the thousand theories which everywhere arise
and spread.</p>

<p class='c006'>The modern age has begun. The saints of the
preceding years had been men of a more militant or
monastic turn, dogmatic minds like Bernard of Clairvaux,
Norbert, Thomas à Becket. The era of charity
and speculative thought begins when the twelfth
century is drawing near the close.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the last year of the eleventh century until
the Christians were finally driven out of Syria in
1291, there had been scarcely a break in the continual
crusade. Throughout the twelfth century this enthusiasm
of pity for the dead Redeemer left in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>hands of infidels was maintained at fever heat. Later
it was softened and widened by the new spirit of
charity towards ailing and erring humankind. But
during the first hundred years of the Holy War it
absorbed all that was holiest and purest, most ardent
and noblest in European manhood. All went to fall
upon the fields of Palestine, or to return strangely
altered after many years. France, England, Germany,
and Flanders, each in her turn commanded
the pious host; but just as these countries were
glorious in the East were they barren and empty at
home. Whole districts of corn land and pasture lapsed
again into moss and marsh. Whole countrysides
were thinned of their hale and active men. A vast
distress and indigence spread over Europe. Those
were hard years for desolate women. Their spinning
and broidery could not buy them bread, and bitter
was the effort to live until their bread-winners
returned. Even when the armies came back from
Palestine there were many who did not return:
many had died of strange Asiatic pestilences, many
had not survived the long journey; the bones of
some were bleached on the desert sand, and others
whitened in the sea. And some of them had gained
the crown which every pious soul then strove and
yearned to win. They had fallen, as Mechtild of
Magdeburg wished to fall, their heart’s blood streaming
under the feet of heathen. And when the thinned
and feeble ranks of the survivors came to their own
country, a very dreadful cry went up from all the
destitute widows in Europe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cruel indeed was their condition. Some, truly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>sought for rest and quiet in the cloister; but in those
days the cloister was death to the world. The
charitable orders of Francis and Dominic were as yet
undreamed of. Only the great meditative orders
offered absolute renunciation and absolute seclusion.
Timid and clinging hearts could not so utterly forego
their world; many busy energetic spirits felt no vocation
for the dreamy quiet of the cloistered nun. And
for these the world was hard. They must beg the
bread which their labour could very seldom earn.
One dreadful trade indeed, which the desires of men
leave ever open to the despair of women, one trade
found many followers. But there were pure and holy
women, and venerable women, and dying women,
who could not live in sin. And there might be seen
in every market-place miserable and hungry petitioners,
crying, “For God’s sake, give us bread;
bread for the love of Christ!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Swestrones Brod durch Got.</em></span> Sisters of bread for
the sake of God. The name often strikes us in later
writing. The singular title has become familiar. For
when we read of piteous uncloistered piety, and when
we read of humble merit rebuking the sins of arrogant
Churchmen, and in the account of strange mystical
heresies, and in the lists of interdicts and burnings,
we shall often meet in the monkish Latin of Germany
and Flanders that outlandish phrase: we shall hear
again of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Swestrones Brod durch Got</em></span>.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>II.</h3>

<p class='c016'>In the year 1180, there lived in Liege a certain
kindly, stammering priest, known from his infirmity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>as Lambert le Bègue. This man took pity on the
destitute widows of his town. Despite the impediment
in his speech, he was, as often happens, a man
of a certain power and eloquence in preaching. His
words, difficult to find, brought conviction when they
came. This Lambert so moved the hearts of his
hearers that gold and silver poured in on him, given
to relieve such of the destitute women of Liege as
were still of good and pious life. With the moneys
thus collected, Lambert built a little square of cottages,
with a church in the middle and a hospital, and
at the side a cemetery. Here he housed these homeless
widows, one or two in each little house, and then
he drew up a half-monastic rule which was to guide
their lives. The rule was very simple, quite informal:
no vows, no great renunciation bound the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Swestrones
Brod durch Got</em></span>. A certain time of the day was set
apart for prayer and pious meditation; the other
hours they spent in spinning or sewing, in keeping
their houses clean, or they went as nurses in time of
sickness into the homes of the townspeople. They
were bidden to be obedient; and to be chaste so long
as they remained of the sisterhood, but they might
marry again at will with no disgrace. If rich women
chose to join the new and unsanctioned guild, they
might leave a portion of their riches to any heir they
chose. Thus these women, though pious and
sequestered, were still in the world and of the world;
they helped in its troubles, and shared its afflictions,
and at choice they might rejoin the conflict.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon we find the name <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Swestrones Brod durch Got</em></span>
set aside for the more usual title of Beguines, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Beghines. Different authorities give different origins
for this word. Some, too fantastic, have traced the
name to St. Begge, a holy nun of the seventh century.
Some have thought it was taken in memory
of the founder, the charitable Lambert le Bègue.
Others think that, even as the Mystics or Mutterers,
the Lollards or Hummers, the Papelhards or Babblers,
so the Beguines or Stammerers were thus
nicknamed from their continual murmuring in prayer.
This is plausible; but not so plausible as the suggestion
of Dr. Mosheim and M. Auguste Jundt, who
derive the word Beguine from the Flemish verb <em>beggen</em>,
to beg. For we know that these pious women had
been veritable beggars; and beggars should they again
become.</p>

<p class='c006'>With surprising swiftness the new order spread
through the Netherlands and into France and Germany.
Every town had its surplus of homeless and
pious widows, and also its little quota of women who
wished to spend their lives in doing good, but had no
vocation for the cloister. The Beguinage, as it was
called, became a home and refuge to either class.
Before 1250 there were Beguines, or Begging Sisters,
at Tirlemont, Valenciennes, Douai, Ghent, Louvain,
and Antwerp in Flanders; at all the principal towns in
France, especially at Cambray, where they numbered
over a thousand; at Bâle and Berne in Switzerland;
at Lübeck, Hamburg, Magdeburg, and many towns in
Germany, with two thousand Beguines at Cologne
and numerous beguinages in the pious town of
Strasburg.</p>

<p class='c006'>So the order spread, within the memory of a man.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Lambert may have lived to see a beguinage in every
great town within his ken; but we hear no more of
him. The Beguines are no longer for Liege, but for
all the world. Each city possessed its quiet congregation;
and at any sick-bed you might meet a woman
clad in a simple smock and a great veil-like mantle,
who lived only to pray and to do deeds of mercy.
They were very pious, these uncloistered sisters of
the poor. Ignorant women who had known the
utmost perils of life and death, their fervour was
warmer, fonder, more illiterate than the devotion
of nuns; they prayed ever as being lately saved
from disgrace and ruin and starvation. Their quiet,
unutterable piety became a proverb, almost a reproach;
much as, within our memories, the unctuous
piety of Methodists was held in England. When the
child Elizabeth of Hungary fasted and saw visions
in the Wartburg, the Princess Agnes, her worldly
sister-in-law, could find no more cruel taunt than
this: “Think you my brother will marry such a
Beguine?” This is in 1213, only eight-and-thirty
years since Lambert built the first asylum for the
destitute widows of Liege.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>III.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The success of the Beguines had made them an
example; the idea of a guild of pious uncloistered
workers in the world had seized the imagination of
Europe. Before St. Francis and St. Dominic instituted
the mendicant orders, there had silently grown
up in every town of the Netherlands a spirit of
fraternity, not imposed by any rule, but the natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>impulse of a people. The weavers seated all day long
alone at their rattling looms, the armourers beating
out their thoughts in iron, the cross-legged tailors and
busy cobblers thinking and stitching together—these
men silent, pious, thoughtful, joined themselves in a
fraternity modelled on that of the Beguines. They
were called the Weaving Brothers. Bound by no
vows and fettered by no rule, they still lived the
worldly life and plied their trade for hire. Only in
their leisure they met together and prayed and
dreamed and thought. Unlettered men, with warm
undisciplined fancies, they set themselves to solve the
greatest mysteries of earth and heaven. Sometimes,
in their sublime and dangerous audacity, they
stumbled on a truth; more often they wandered far
afield, led by the will-o’-the-wisp of their own unguided
thoughts. In the long busy hours of weaving
and stitching they found strange answers to the
problems of human destiny, and, in their leisure,
breathless and eager, discussed these theories as
other men discussed their chance of better wage.
Such were the founders of the great fraternity of
Fratres Textores, or Beghards as in later years the
people more generally called them. And their philosophy
is so strangely abstract and remote that we
could not explain it, did we not know that from time
to time some secular priest or wealthy and pious laymen
joined the humble fraternity. And the priest
would bring, to their store of dim wonderings, <a id='corr8.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='the the'>the</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_8.29'><ins class='correction' title='the the'>the</ins></a></span>
Alexandrian theories of the pseudo-Dionysius,
then, in all the monasteries of Christendom, deemed
the very corner-stone of sacred philosophy. We can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>imagine how eagerly these simple folk would seize the
hallowed fragments of Erigena and of the Areopagite,
and how they would treasure them as holy secrets in
the depth of their tender and mystical souls. We
know that now and then a consecrated priest would
join the unsanctioned but pious order of the Beghards;
it is no great stretch of fancy to suppose that
from time to time, some Crusader, fresh from the
East, would bring them his memory of Eastern
theories; that some scholar would add a line from
Avicenna or Averroes. Through some channel, it is
evident, the Beghards received the last feeble stream
of Alexandrian theory. Their vague, idealistic pantheism
is but an echo of Plotinus and his school.
From the monasteries, from the Arabian commentators
on Aristotle, or directly from the East, these
fragments of neoplatonist philosophy must have
reached them; and out of them there should be
evolved, first of all, the great metaphysical heresies
of the Middle Ages; and, later on, the habit of
mind that should produce the German Reformation.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c016'>While the Beghards and the Beguines were slowly,
imperceptibly nearing the great abyss of heresy, the
creation of two new orders at Rome insidiously took
from them the greater part of their prestige. Until
the Franciscans and Dominicans obtained the sanction
of the Pope, the beguinage had seemed the
natural mean between the life of the cloister and the
life of the world. But the new charitable orders had
all the activity, the beneficence of the Beguines, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>therewith the friendship and protection of Rome.
For some time longer the Beguines flourished, still
orthodox and reputable; but the order had received
its death-blow on the day when Francis and Dominic
obtained the Papal sanction for their Tertiary Orders
of Penitence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tertiary orders of Dominic and Francis were a
new departure from the exclusive theories of Roman
monasticism. They were invented for men and
women of holy life, married and still living in the
world, who wished for some nearer association with
the Church than belongs to the ordinary member of a
congregation. They took their part in worldly joys
and sorrows, triumphs and failures; but they prayed
longer than other worldly folk, did more good works,
looked more for heaven. The institution of these
orders was a wide breach in the barrier which divides
the cloister from the world, the sacred from the profane.
They were, in fact, as the reader has perceived,
merely an hierarchic version of those fraternities
which the unconsecrated poor had made among
themselves: Beguines and Beghards protected by the
Church.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the idea of the secular beguinage was transformed
into a sacred thing. The example of the
Beguines had been followed by the Church, who, in
consecrating these new orders, made an immense reform
in the old exclusive monastic ideal, a tremendous
concession to the new democratic spirit inspiring all
men. Hitherto the cloister had been a refuge and
asylum from the noisy nations without. It had been
as an ark, floating over the stormy waters, offering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>safety indeed to those inside it, yet not concerned with
the clamorous multitude that drowned and struggled
beyond it in the increasing flood. The aim of Francis
and of Dominic was to quit this aloof and lofty shelter,
to go and reprove the erring and rescue the ignorant,
to be the friend and brother of sinners and publicans,
of Magdalens and lepers, to revert, in fact, to the old
democratic ideal of the Christian Church. They were
to be poor among the poor, armed only with the
armour of faith. They were to be in the world the
heralds of God. The sisters of the orders were to be
humble women, the brothers mendicant friars. At
first they took no more from the world than the
wandering Beguines took in later days—only water,
bread, and a garment. But this strict rule of absolute
poverty was soon removed, and the Dominicans,
at all events, were never destitute.</p>

<p class='c006'>Each order had its different mission. The Dominicans,
the preaching brothers, should persuade the
hard of heart, strengthen the failing, console the
desolate, warn the erring, and exterminate the heretic.
Yet, singularly enough, this most orthodox order,
these watch-dogs of the Lord, were to become in
Germany a centre of mystical heresies. The order
of St. Francis, the Lesser Brothers, had a more
tender and ecstatic ideal. They went begging
through the world, tending the sick, loving the
helpless, preaching to the birds and the fishes, full of
a quaint compassionate unworldliness, a holy folly.
There were few hearts so hard that, though unshaken
by the storms of Dominic, they did not melt before
the sweet Franciscan sanctity. And so the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>orders traversed the world, twin forces and voices
of pity. But the chivalrous and militant pity of
Dominic, eager to avenge the outraged Christ continually
crucified by infidels, too often took the
form of wrath and burnings, while Francis loved
the erring with a simple human pity. In return
the world bestowed, and still bestows, upon him
something of the wondering compassionate reverence
which Eastern nations give to the Pure Fool, the
man unsoiled by the wisdom of the world and still
wrapped round with the simplicity of God. Between
them, the two orders were to divide the Christian
world. Sanctioned in the same year and under the
same hospitable rule of Augustine, they went out
triumphantly upon their different missions. Inspired,
it is most probable, by the example of the
Beguines, they would soon absorb the secular order
into their mighty forces. And the real decline of
Beguinism begins, not in 1250, when first the secular
fraternities became conspicuous for heresy, but on
that day of the year 1216 when the learned Dominic
and the visionary Francis met and embraced each
other in the streets of Rome.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>V.</h3>

<p class='c016'>At first the external position of the Beguines and
the Beghards appeared in no danger and no disadvantage.
Their fraternity had always been a secular
fraternity; their condition of pious laymen was one
which offered sanctity with independence. The
beguinages still thrived and multiplied. In the Low
Countries especially, and in Cambray, Strasburg,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and Cologne,—places where mysticism has ever
been dear, and ecclesiastical authority never a welcome
yoke—Beguinism grew apace. But there is
no doubt that one great cause which for thirty years
averted the ruin of the secular fraternities was the
presence in their midst of one of the most remarkable
women of her century; a woman who, to the Beguines,
was all that St. Elizabeth was to the
Franciscans, or that Catherine of Siena should
become to the order of St. Dominic. This gifted and
singular creature was the prophetess Mechtild of
Magdeburg.</p>

<p class='c006'>We do not know the name of the castle where, in
the year 1212, Mechtild of Magdeburg was born. It
cannot have been very far from the city which was to
be her refuge, and whose name she bears. The title
of her father is also lost; but it is certain she came
of noble and courtly stock. Her family were probably
religious people, for we know that her brother
Baldwin became one of the Dominicans of Halle.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mechtild was, as she herself recalls, the dearest of
her parents’ children; and these courtly and pious
Thuringian nobles seem to have been as proud as
they were fond of their little daughter. She received
a liberal education. Her book on the flowing light of
Godhead is written with an energy, sweetness, and
variety of style strongly in contrast with the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gertrudenbuch</span>
and the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mechtildenbuch</span> of Helfta. The
music of her verse proves her familiar with the lyrics
of the Minnesingers. They may no doubt have
visited her father’s castle. But the little Mechtild
did not dream of poetry and of knights-at-arms. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>was later that she would deplore the poor vain <a id='corr14.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='mintrels'>minstrels</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_14.1'><ins class='correction' title='mintrels'>minstrels</ins></a></span>
who in hell weep more tears than there are
waters in the sea.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Her thoughts in childhood were
all for the saints in heaven. When she was twelve
years old, the little girl was (as she records it) visited
by the Holy Spirit; and from that moment she
desired to quit the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a moment of intense spiritual exaltation,
this year 1224. Close at hand in the Wartburg the
seventeen-year-old Landgravine Elizabeth was exciting
the wonder of her people by her pieties and
sweet austerities. The bread miraculously turned
into heavenly roses, the leper whom she tended
transformed into the shining Christ, the stories of her
visions and her scourgings would certainly be familiar
to the little Mechtild. The Emperor Frederic II. was
already collecting his nobles for his ill-starred and
heretic crusade. On Monte Laverna, in this very
year, St. Francis received the stigmata. Blanche of
Castile and the child St. Louis were ruling Paris as
King Arthur might have ruled his court at Camelot,
by the authority of love and gentleness. At the
same time the ghastly prevalence of leprosy and
pestilence, of war and hideous famine, made the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>world as dreadful as heaven was desirable. Those
who recall the condition of Eisenach, as revealed by
the life of St. Elizabeth, may imagine the sights of
human suffering which little Mechtild must have
encountered every day. And close by, in the vast
woods of Prussia, dwelt heathen folk who knew of
nothing better than this cruel world. In that very
year some of the crusader knights had set out to
conquer that pagan kingdom. Thus with on one
hand holy Thuringia and with heathen Prussia on
the other, with war, famine, and pestilence frequent
petitioners at her gates, it is not surprising that the
little Mechtild shared the spiritual fervours of her
time, and longed to give herself to Heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>But she did not, like Gertrude and Mechtild of
Hackeborn, enter a convent in her infancy. Most
likely she yielded to the entreaties of her family, “of
whom she was ever the dearest.” Year after year
passed on, and Mechtild still dwelt in her father’s
castle. Yet, after that one childish moment of ecstacy,
the sweetness and honour of the world were to
her as vain and perishable things. And still she was
not visited again with trance or vision. She was no
dreamer, this eager Mechtild, but a vigorous and
healthy girl, in the flower of her beautiful and lusty
youth, alert, passionate, with a mind awake to all the
questions and interest of the world around her. Such
a nature is not by instinct a mystical nature; but the
strange contagion of the time had touched her, and
worked slowly through her innermost being. Stronger
and stronger grew the strenuous unworldly prompting:
“<em>without sin, to be disgraced before the world</em>.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>For eleven years the desire waxed and strengthened;
for eleven years did Mechtild combat this
desire. Daily it grew more impelling, more subduing.
At last, in the year 1235, the year of the
canonization of Elizabeth, when Mechtild was twenty-three
years old, she secretly left her father’s house,
and fled to Magdeburg. She left all behind her—brothers
and sisters, father and mother, “of whom
she was the dearest,” and the courtly honourable life,
and the quiet happiness of love and safety. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Frau
Minne, ihr habt mir benommen weltlich Ehre und allen
weltlichen Reichthum!</em></span> Everything indeed she left, to
follow the goading impulse of Sacred Love.</p>

<p class='c006'>When she reached the strange city, when she had
left far behind her the distant home where even now
her kinsmen would wonder, and miss her, and make
a search, when the night fell on her in Magdeburg,
Mechtild desired a shelter. Weary with her flight,
she resolved to ask some nunnery to lend her its
asylum. Within those holy walls she could more
truly yield herself to God.</p>

<p class='c006'>She knocked at a convent door, and begged for
shelter, saying she desired to become a nun. But the
quiet sisters distrusted this beautiful, travel-stained
young woman of three-and-twenty, without means, or
friends, or reference, alone at night in the turbulent
city streets—this girl who, by her own confession,
had fled her father’s house. Soon those doors were
closed against her. There were, however, many
convents in a great archiepiscopal city such as
Magdeburg. To convent after convent went the
despairing girl, finding at each, no doubt, rest for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>limbs and food for the body, but in none of all of
them a home. For no religious house would admit
this unfriended and suspicious creature into its pure
community. When the last doors had closed upon
her, Mechtild stood in the street, alone in Magdeburg.
It must have come upon her then, I think, that at
last her great desire was granted—<em>Without sin, she
was disgraced before the world.</em></p>

<p class='c006'>When Mechtild left her parents’ castle, she had
chosen Magdeburg to be her hiding-place, because in
that town there lived a friend of her family. She
had thought to stay her heart upon the thought of
this unvisited friend, who might be her last resource
in case of extremity. But now the need was felt,
Mechtild did not seek him. He would, she knew,
endeavour to persuade her from the path that she
had chosen, and Mechtild was in need of all her
courage.</p>

<p class='c006'>So, unfriended, alone, she stood in the streets of
Magdeburg. Then she bethought her of another
shelter, humble indeed, but safe. And she had left
home only to be humbled. What humiliation would
there have been in entering, like the dear St. Elizabeth,
the holy order of St. Francis? Or what
abasement had she, like her brother, embraced the
rule of Dominic, “dearest to me,” she avers, “of all
the saints”? Here there was no spiritual sacrifice.
And what sacrifice of life, of social habit, of esteem
could she have made had she entered one of the great
Cistercian or Benedictine convents, where the nobles
of Saxony and Thuringia were proud to send their
daughters? Mechtild was glad that they had rejected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>her; it seemed to her that at last, pure of
pride, free of weak desire, she saw her own will made
plain and the directing will of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>She moved now; she knew what to do and where
to go; she was no longer unguided and alone. She
went to the beguinage, the home of mendicant
widows, the almshouse of the holy poor who gave
themselves to God. At that door, which debarred no
one from the outer world, Mechtild knocked. A poor
woman opened to her, clad in a plain smock and a
great mantle covering head and shoulders. Such
another gown and cloak was lying by, ready for the
welcome Mechtild. She entered the house.</p>

<p class='c006'>That night Mechtild stood in her little cell. It was
much like any convent cell; but it was without a
convent’s restrictions or its privileges. Mechtild
might quit those walls this year, next year, any
year. She might marry and have children. She
had, after all, offered up no sacrifice of her own body;
she was not dead to the world, but was to live and
labour in it more nearly now than in her father’s
castle. No great barrier should stand henceforth
between her soul and sin. The battle was not over;
it was but just begun.</p>

<p class='c006'>Far easier had been the greater sacrifice, done
once and done for ever! Far more peaceful the
quiet nunnery, hallowed to rapture and seclusion!
Mechtild was now the servant only, and not the bride
of Christ. She was a Beguine, not a nun. The
accomplished daughter of nobles, she was the companion
of the destitute and lowly. It was better
thus, better to be lowly and despised, even as Christ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>was despised. All these thoughts of dismay, rapture,
weariness, and exaltation, rushed and clashed through
the tired breast of Mechtild. Then, for a second
time, the trance crept over her, and she sank unconscious
into the ever-present arms of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then, in a vision, Mechtild saw how henceforward
her life should be doubly glorious and doubly beset
with peril. For she beheld the angel and the devil,
who to this moment had been permitted to guide her
and assail her, each miraculously changed into twain.
Now at her right there stood a cherub, with gifts and
holy wisdom on his azure wings, and a seraph bearing
her a heart of love. But on the left two devils
watched her—two devils who, in all times, have lain
in wait for the mystic and the solitary visionary. And
the name of the one was Vain-Glory, and that of the
other Vain-Desire.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VI.</h3>

<p class='c016'>From the night of that vision begins the career of
Mechtild and the history of her visions and her
prophecies. At first, indeed, occupied in conquering
her strong and lusty youth, the visions of Mechtild
of Magdeburg are little different from those of any
convent saint. Angels and devils, the beautiful
manhood of our Lord, fragments from the Song of
Solomon, the rapture of the Spiritual Nuptials—such
are the inevitable themes. But this woman, we
feel, is no mere Gertrude or Mechtild of Hackeborn.
The whole world interests her, and the destinies of
the world. In reading the book in which she wrote
her visions, the book of the flowing light of Godhead,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>we soon pass over this initial stage to a second and
wider phase.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>These pregnant words begin Mechtild’s “Vision of
Hell.” The plan of this great vision, which beholds,
built in succeeding and widening terraces, the habitations
of sinners, with fire and darkness, stench and
cold, and pain in the bottommost pit, no less than
the scheme of the poem, which lashes many a prevalent
sin of the Church, both alike recall a far
greater poet yet unborn, one who should also explore
the depths of hell and the heights of heaven, one
who should accept as his guide towards Paradise a
certain mysterious Matilda,</p>

earnest minstrel of heaven, the loving and singing
Mechtild of Magdeburg.</p>

<p class='c006'>The form of Mechtild’s visions did not make her
popular among the churchmen of her city. The
people caught up the lilting, dancing measures of her
songs. The pious sang her visions. And girls, to
whom a nun had ever seemed a cold and sacred being,
could understand the happy verses of the fearless love
of God, in which Mechtild claims for herself an
impulse as natural, as irresistible, as any maiden’s
love of her betrothed:—</p>

<p class='c006'>In the convents of Helfta and Quedlinburg these
songs spread and furthered the great renown of
Mechtild. Heinrich von Halle, the famous Dominican,
went to see her, and became her friend. But
the secular priests did not love her, this Beguine
reformer, this new unsanctioned Abbess Hildegard,
who saw so clearly and bewailed so explicitly the
many corruptions which had crept upon the Church
even in that age of faith, even in the century of St.
Francis and St. Dominic, of King Louis and Elizabeth
of Hungary. Some of these secular priests
tried to burn her book; thereupon Mechtild saw a
vision and heard the voice of God crying aloud:
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“<em>Lieb’ meine, betrübe dich nicht zu sehr, die Wahrheit
mag niemand verbrennen.</em>”</span></p>

<p class='c006'>Profound and touching phrase, motto of all martyrs
and of every cause: No one can burn the Truth!
Had the world but learned by heart this one poignant
sentence, uttered in the very age which began the
persecution of heretics, how many wars, deaths,
angers, cruelties, centuries of remorse and hatred
had not the world been spared! All honour to this
woman, who, six centuries ago, perceived how vain it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>is to hunt, slay, burn, exterminate an idea. This
sentence should be immortal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mechtild continued to speak what seemed to
her the most necessary truth. “Pope and priests,”
she cries, “are going the road to hell. Unless
they quit their sensuality, their spiritual negligence,
their temporal greed, fearful disasters will
overwhelm them.” “In this book,” she says, “I
write with my heart’s blood.” She is no unfilial
antagonist threatening the power of Rome, but a
daughter striving to lead her parent back into the
holy way. She has a vision, and sees perverted
Christendom lying, “like an impure virgin,” far from
the throne of God. She takes it in the arms of her
soul, and strives to lift it nearer. “Leave hold!”
cries the tremendous voice of God; “she is too great
a weight for thee.” And Mechtild looks up and
smiles. “Eia, my Lord!” she cries; “I will carry
her to Thy feet with Thine own arms that Thou
didst outspread upon the cross for her!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the aim of Mechtild: to bring the over-powerful
and worldly Roman hierarchy back to the
primitive and democratic ideal of Christianity. She
has the courage of her intention, and shrinks not
from rebuking error, however high its place. She,
the Beguine, the sister of the poor, wrote to the Dean
of Magdeburg censuring the notoriously idle and
voluptuous lives of his clergy. “Let him sleep upon
straw, and his canons take and eat it for their
fodder!” Perhaps it is not wonderful the clergy of
Magdeburg did not love the prophetess.</p>

<p class='c006'>Also she wrote to the Pope, to Clement IV., whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>tolerance of the murder of Conradine had lost him
many loyal German hearts, whose lax and irreligious
court was Gomorrah in the sight of Mechtild. And
these priests and prelates, this all-powerful Pope, if
they do not reform and obey, yet listen they humbly
to the words of this unsanctioned nun, this secular
sister of Magdeburg.</p>

<p class='c006'>Never again have the Beguines attained so fine, so
pure an eminence. They are indeed still poor, still
lowly, still unrecognized, still Beguines. But these
negations are become their glory and their distinction.
Which life is nearer the ideal life of Christendom,
the life of a great prelate or the life of the Beguine?
The priests hear and listen, for the moment abashed
because of their splendour and their power. The
Beguines are poor, unlettered, unprotected; but they
are nearer the simplicity of God, that <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>reine heilige
Einfalt</em></span> which the Beguine Mechtild well knows how
to praise.</p>

<p class='c006'>So for thirty years Mechtild preached against error
and prophesied punishment, sang of the love of God,
and saw visions of a hell where wicked ecclesiastics
burn for persecuting the innocent. For thirty years
she lived, in her beguinage, the strenuous, earnest,
indignant life of the reforming seer, the life of
Dante, the life of Savonarola. And then the
vigorous frame wore out. In her fifty-third year
even Mechtild saw that an end must be put to this
unrelaxed endeavour. Fain would she have gone,
like Jutta von Schönhausen, into the wild woods
to preach to the heathen Prussians. But this could
not be; the body was too weak. She retired to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Cistercian cloister of Helfta, the home of the great
Abbess Gertrude, and of her sister, the younger
Mechtild. But even there she did not rest. “What
shall I do in a cloister—I?” she demanded in
agonized prayers. “Teach and enlighten,” answered
a heavenly voice. And so for twelve years longer
Mechtild lives, and teaches the cloister of the great
world beyond its walls, and finishes her book on the
flowing light of Godhead, till, honoured and loved
by all, she ends her eventful life in the year 1277.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VII.</h3>

<p class='c016'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Reine, Heilige Einfalt</em></span>; such is the phrase in which
Mechtild praised her God. <em>Pure, holy simplicity</em>; it
is the praise of the Beguines and the Mystics, the
beginning of pantheism. But Mechtild is no pantheist;
she strenuously believes in the personality of
the soul, the reality of Christ, the existence of the
world, and in heaven and in hell. She is an orthodox
and Catholic Christian; yet she is stirred by the
spirit of her time.</p>

<p class='c006'>“God,” she says, “is pure simplicity; out of the
eternal spring of Deity I flowed, and all things flow,
and thence shall all return.” These earnest phrases
of mystical pantheism escape her lips, though they
do not touch her heart. She does not consider all
that they imply; for if all things, having arisen in
the Deity, flow back to their source when life is over,
how can Evil have a real existence, how can sinners
be punished for ever in the city of Eternal Hate? If
God be the one thing real, there is no evil and there
is no hell. If all souls released from existence return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>to that pure and holy simplicity, there is no personal
immortality either for bliss or for bale. Mechtild did
not perceive the bearings and the consequences of her
phrase; but the Beguines pushed the meaning to its
term. The pantheism of Alexandria, the pantheism
of the suppressed Almarician heresy, stirred and
quickened in the thoughts of pious and schismatic
Beguinism. And pantheism, with its two extremes
of austerity and sensualism, increased and deepened
in the sect.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mystical pantheism, which asserts that God is all
and matter nothing; the spirit all, the body but
a transitory veil; thought and mind eternal, sense
and sensuous pleasure of no account for evil or for
good; this doctrine is capable of two interpretations.
It may be the religion of Plotinus and pure souls.
It may absolutely ignore the body; it may mean the
life of the mind and the soul carried always to the
highest possible pitch. Or it may be, and too often
is, the excuse of the basest sensualism. There is a
page of psychology in the changed meaning of the
word Libertine. Since, neither for sin nor for sanctity,
the body can affect the soul, since sensuous
pleasures are quite independent of the spiritual existence,
the lower pantheism may excuse debauch as a
permissible relaxation not affecting the spirit. And
this is what it generally does come to mean among
communities of undisciplined and ill-educated enthusiasts.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is gradually what it came to mean among the
Beghards and the Beguines, or at least among a large
proportion of them. Some, indeed, praying to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Pure and Holy Simplicity, endeavoured to live only
in the pureness of their souls, and thus to become
one with that inspiring spirit. Such were
the Beguines of Strasburg. And a section of the
secular communities, dreading these continual inroads
of heresy, entrenched themselves in Catholic
orthodoxy, and enlisted in the third orders of Dominic
and Francis. But the great remainder was absorbed
by a vague mystical pantheism, which, placing the
soul too high to be affected by the matters of the
flesh, made this opinion an excuse for a complete
independence of the moral law.</p>

<p class='c006'>Towards the close of the life of Mechtild the
prestige of Beguinism had seriously declined. Innocent
IV. and Urban IV. had taken the secular order
under their peculiar protection, but in 1274, Pope
Gregory X. renewed against it the sentence of the
Lateran Council and declared the Beguines unrecognized
by Rome. Following this official condemnation,
the blame of lesser men came thick and fast;
and by the end of the thirteenth century the secular
fraternities were popular only among the poor, only
among the laymen and the people. They were
discredited and heretic among the clergy.</p>

<p class='c006'>For thirty years before the sentence of Gregory
complaints of the Beguines and the Beghards had
been sent to Rome from the prelates of Germany
and Flanders. The two demons foreseen by Mechtild,
the demon of vainglory and the demon of sensual
sin, had entered in among these quiet homes of
prayer. Already in 1244 there were scandals among
the younger sisters, and the Archbishop of Mayence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>decreed that the beguinages of his diocese should
receive no women under forty years of age. Already
in 1250 Albertus Magnus at Cologne had met with
heretic Beghards, men whose vague pantheism was
to grow and spread among the order, until all
distinction should be lost between the Beghards and
the heretic Brothers of the Free Spirit. Already
they had returned to their old habits, wandering
through the streets, ragged as an Eastern fakir,
praying aloud and begging of the passers-by: “Bread,
for the sake of God!” Too much ignorance with
too much liberty had gone far to destroy and pervert
the real uses of the order. The great moment of
Beguinism, its time of independent poverty and
secular piety, the time of Mechtild of Magdeburg,
was past and gone. The third stage of vagabondage
and heresy had begun.</p>

<p class='c006'>That period, we must remember, was one which, in
the Church itself, was a period of corruption and of
schism. There is no charge brought against the secular
order, which might not equally be brought against
the regular monks and nuns. The long wave of
pantheism which preceded the Reformation engulfed
the ignorant Beguines in a hundred perversions of
an idea ill explained, misunderstood; but that same
wave overwhelmed Master Eckhart and the Dominican
Mystics. Only the Roman Church, jealous of the
unrecognized order, was swift to hear the low voice
of the Beguines murmuring, “<em>God is all that exists.</em>”</p>

<p class='c006'>This one phrase caught, repeated, whispered, half
understood, misunderstood, often not understood at
all, spread with the swiftness and authority of gospel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>among the Beghards and the Beguines of Europe.
Soon in Italy, the vagrant sect of Apostolici, the
followers of Segarelli, and the Franciscan Fraticelli
in France, and the Beghards and Beguines of Northern
Europe, all were murmuring together that one phrase,
that key-word of pantheism, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<em>Deus est formaliter
omne.</em></span>”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not easy to prevent the growth of an idea
among a community so widely spread, so constantly
changing. Segarelli was burned at Parma all in
vain. His doctrines had percolated everywhere.
Inspired by the example of the mendicant orders,
many of the Beghards and Beguines had returned to
the vagabond life. Pious vagrants all in rags,
staffless, scripless, they wandered through the country
from beguinage to beguinage, begging for their food
along the way. It was a change indeed from the
early habits of the order, so busy, so hard at work,
so pious, so responsible. But in the hearts of the
lowest classes the secular fraternities were never so
dear, never so much revered as now. In 1295 the
Council of Mayence forbad them to wander through
the streets, exciting public pity and crying, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“<em>Brod
durch Got!</em>”</span> and Guillaume de St. Amour lamented
that the people were blinded by the rags, the hunger,
the false piety of these vagrants. This, of course,
is the view of churchmen who did not entertain such
strict opinions with regard to the merit of Franciscan
mendicants. Indeed, much of the ill-favour with
which the Church regarded the wandering Beghards
and Beguines of these later days may be set down
to a jealousy lest the piety of these irregular brothers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>should defraud the begging orders of their due.
From one cause or another the thunders of the
Church began to fall heavy and frequent upon the
secular fraternities.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1310 the Council of Treves disposed of the pretensions
of the Beghards in what appeared a sufficiently
decisive manner. The Beghards were called
an imaginary congregation, idle fugitives from honest
labour, false interpreters of Scripture, mendicant
vagabonds unsanctioned by the Church.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1311, at the Council of Vienna, Clement V.
decreed the total suppression of Beguinism. But
the sentence was severe. Too many innocent must
suffer with the guilty. In the same year the Pope
revoked his sentence, and allowed the orthodox and
irreproachable among the Beguines to live “according
to the inspiration of the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But from this time Beguinism as an institution
was at an end. The “orthodox and irreproachable”
were Beghards and Beguines who had joined the
Tertiary Order of Francis or of Dominic. The
secular order was no longer secular; the aim of the
Beguines was falsified and changed.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VIII.</h3>

<p class='c016'>In the year 1328 nearly fifty Libertines or Brothers
of the Free Spirit were publicly burned at Cologne.</p>

<p class='c006'>The persecution of the wandering Beguines and
Beghards had thoroughly begun. In the history of
the time, in the chronicles of any town along the
Rhine or in the Low Countries, we may meet the
dolorous little entry: On such a day so many Beghards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>were burned or imprisoned in perpetual <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>In
pace</em></span>. A special German Inquisition was instituted
against them.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is the old cruel war of intolerance and heresy,
the vain and shameful struggle with which six
centuries are full. But there was here a more than
usual excuse for the excessive severity of Rome.
Europe was fast being ruined by these mendicant
wanderers. Begging friars of St. Francis, Carmelites,
Dominicans, numerous new orders which flourished
for a while, and died, and are forgotten, all these
flooded the country with pious vagrants for whom
the impoverished laymen must provide. And in
addition to all these orthodox idlers, there was now
a countless horde of wandering Beghards, no less
ignorant, no less incapable of warfare or of labour,
and, in addition, pestilent heretics. Such was the
view of the Church.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fifty years before, Gregory X. had tried to reduce
“the unbridled throng of mendicants, who are a
heavy burden alike on Church and people;” but his
efforts had been in vain. The poor of every nation
and of every time are quick to ascribe piety to those
who, ragged and homeless, assert that the life to come
shall repay them for their sufferings here. Half
starved, down-trodden, little better than slaves, the
peasants of Germany would share their squalid meal
thankfully with the wandering friar. It was little less
than sacrilege to refuse a portion to the holy man.
This was the natural attitude of the people. They
gave, and did not complain.</p>

<p class='c006'>They gave, and the friars took, and the Beghards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>took, and still the cry was “Give.” The Fratricelli,
Apostolici, Beghards, Beguines, Brothers of the Free
Spirit, overran the whole of Europe. These all must
be fed no less than the orthodox fraternities. And
year by year the number of the mendicants increased.
The careless wandering life without responsibility or
consequence, the absence of ties or of toil, the prestige
in idleness, attracted the vagabond and lazy. And
many of the pious really believed it the noblest human
life. Since the idea of Divinity was simplicity, mere
simplicity, then the more the saint was simplified and
the less heed he took for apparel or for food the nearer
he was to heaven. These men and women, strange
descendants of the spinning sisters and the Fratres
Textores, were like the lilies of the field inasmuch as
they toiled not, neither did they spin. They thus
fulfilled the popular ideal of piety. Year by year
labour and forethought grew more discredited, as it
was discovered that, if you did not feed yourself, a
more worldly person would always feed you; until in
1317 we read in the sentences collected by Johann
von Ochsenstein that no exterior motive, <em>not even the
desire of the kingdom of heaven, should tempt a good
man towards activity</em>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was in vain for even the Pope to preach, for
Guillaume de St. Amour to attack all mendicants
alike, for councils and bishops to thunder against the
indolence, the mendicancy, the lax morals and loose
opinions of these men. The mendicants grew more
and more. The nations groaned under the holy
burden. Then, about 1310, unable to contain her
displeasure any longer, the Church bursts forth into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>interdicts and persecution. Fifty Beghards are burned
at Cologne. At Magdeburg some Beguines are cast
into prison. At Strasburg, at Constance, at Mayence,
the Beguines and Beghards are punished unless
converted within three days. It is war to the knife
against the wandering heretics.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>IX.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Under the pressure of a displeasure so severe, the
greater number of the Beghards and Beguines accepted
the rule of the tertiary orders. The mother
became submissive to her children. The larger party
of the fraternity, including all the Flemish beguinages,
accepted the Franciscan rule; but the Beghards and
Beguines of Strasburg, the most suspected of any,
joined the Tertiary Order of Dominic. Thus the
heresy of Beguinism appeared for a while overcome.</p>

<p class='c006'>But at the same time a strange mystical pantheistic
tendency became noticeable in many sermons and
lessons of the Church herself. All this multitude of
heretic Beguines, suddenly made orthodox within
three days, all this vast accession of vague Almarician
piety was not without an influence on the conquering
faith. Among the Dominicans of Strasburg the
mystical bent grew more decided year by year.
These much-admired doctors and magisters were
lights of the Church, men of influence and learning;
but the mysticism which was orthodox in them was
really identical with the neoplatonist theories of the
Beghards. And, indeed, these men,—Eckhart,
Tauler, Rulmann Merswin—went further in the way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>of pantheism than the heretic brotherhood had gone
before.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is impossible to exterminate an idea. It must
live its course, grow, flourish, and die. Be it wise or
foolish, orthodox or heterodox, let it but have some
new aspect of truth in it; let it but be fresh, profound,
and striking; let it be truly and verily an idea:
it will live its life before it dies its natural death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the idea of the Beguines, arbitrarily suppressed,
yet flourished only the more. Like a brier
budded on a rose tree, it brought out its wild and
fragile blossoms among the ordered beauties of the
ecclesiastical garden. In the great Dominican
mystics of Strasburg the central thought of heretic
Beguinism (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<em>Deus est omnia</em>”</span>) flourished more completely
than before.</p>

<p class='c006'>God is all: the world is nothing. This is what
the mystics of Strasburg and the mystics of the
Netherlands now began to preach to the world.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>X.</h3>

<p class='c016'>From the year 1312 until 1320 Master Eckhart,
the great Dominican preacher, was living in Strasburg.
His deep and original mind, which so vastly
was to influence the speculation of his time, was now
itself brought under the influence of Beguinism.
From 1312 to 1317 he preached and visited in the
Dominican beguinages of Strasburg. Always a
mystic and a neoplatonist, before that date he
was not suspected of <a id='corr33.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='hersey'>heresy</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_33.28'><ins class='correction' title='hersey'>heresy</ins></a></span>. The theories of the
Dominican Beguines agreed perfectly with the convictions
of this singular being, who preached in accents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>of strenuous sincerity the doctrine of the unreality of
matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the Beguines of his diocese was one whom
Eckhart adopted to be his spiritual daughter. But the
relation of the Beguine Sister Katrei to the great
Vicar-general of the Dominican order was scarcely
that attitude of submission which we expect from a
penitent to her confessor. She leads him on to new
audacities of faith, suggests new penances, refuses all
restraint. She shows him how an earnest nature
can reduce to practice his special tenet that the
world is nothing, that God alone exists.</p>

<p class='c006'>Katrei was the daughter of worthy Strasburg
townspeople. Not necessity, but an enthusiasm for
self-humiliation drove her to the beguinage. Ever
in doubt of her own salvation, she multiplied her
fasts and penances till even her director beseeched
her to take some pity on her starved and shattered
body. But Katrei would not be persuaded; not yet,
she declared, was the old Adam slain in her; not yet
was she “dead all through.” As Mechtild of Magdeburg
is the great active type of the order, so Katrei
represents the passive Beguinism. She had no
reforming zeal; she belonged to the later school, to
those who said: “Not even the desire of the kingdom
of heaven must tempt a good man towards
activity.”</p>

<p class='c006'>To free herself from the world and the claims of the
world, to leave behind the flesh and all the needs and
desires of the flesh, this was the overmastering preoccupation
of Swester Katrei. She left the sheltering
beguinage, the faces too familiar to be easily forgotten,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>the neighbourhood of father and of mother, and set
out alone upon the wandering Beguine’s life. With her
she took neither staff nor scrip. “All that I ask of
the world,” she said, “is a spring, a crust, and a
garment” (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>brunnen, brod, und ein rock</em></span>). So for
many months she went, absorbed in her own soul,
forgetting men and women, earthly pleasure, earthly
love, and earthly duty, and at last returned to Strasburg
to be known by no one there.</p>

<p class='c006'>She was not yet satisfied. Her ideal was not yet
reached. “Not yet,” she persisted, “am I dead all
through.” “Nay,” answered the confessor (behind
whose cowl we see the face of Eckhart), “not so long
as thou rememberest who was thy father and who
thy mother; not so long as thou shalt care if thy
priest refused to confess thee or absolve thee; not so
long as it shall disturb thee if thou mayest not taste
the body of God; not so long as thou shalt grieve
when none will shelter thee, and all despise thee;
not until then, my sister, canst thou know the real
death unto self.” Then again, Katrei retired into the
wilderness, and for a long time she wandered to and
fro across the face of the earth. When she returned
she was strangely changed; even her confessor did
not know her. At last, her cataleptic trances growing
daily longer and more profound, she being permanently
raised into a strange hysteric insensibility
to pain or hunger, she lay the whole day long without
food or drink or movement in a corner of the great
cathedral. Now she was dead to outer things.
“Now,” she said, “I am God.” Her father and her
mother came and cried to her, half abashed at her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>holiness, half agonized at her condition. But Katrei
did not know them now. She no longer recognized
what she looked upon; the world and all within it
was a blank to her.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last, one day, the trance deepened; she ceased
to breathe. Some people of the church, thinking her
dead, took her away to bury her. But when they
returned to the church with Katrei on the bier, her
confessor, approaching, perceived she was not really
dead. “Art thou satisfied?” he demanded; and
she answered, “I am satisfied at last.” She would
have let them bury her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Quietism can go no further than this. When this
singular woman died, between 1312 and 1320, though
the Church already began to censure the mystical
errors of Beguinism, yet her piety was deemed so
great that Meister Eckhart wrote a memoir of
her life as an example and an exhortation to the
pious. She is the saint of the later Beguinism, even
as the vigorous Mechtild of Magdeburg is the patron
of the older style.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>XI.</h3>

<p class='c016'>But sister Katrei had too many followers, and
gradually the sense of the religious world revolted
from this numb and dead ideal. Already, in the
writings of Suso (1335), of Ruysbrock, and Rulmann
Merswin, men whose idealist mysticism was little
different from the Beguine heresy, the quietism of
these “false freemen” is utterly condemned. Suso,
in his Book of Truth, recounts how he met on a
journey one of these wandering Beghards, who, to all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>his questions, responded much as Parsifal responds
to Gurnemanz. Whence he came and whither going,
the wanderer does not know. He is called the Nameless
Savage. He is Nothing abysmed in the Divine
Nothingness. Without will or desire he obeys his
natural instincts, since any conflict with them would
destroy the quiet of his soul. Such is the latest type
of the secular brotherhood; but this, unlike Sister
Katrei, meets no approval from the marvelling Church.</p>

<p class='c006'>Indeed, the Beghards and the Beguines, with their
lax morals, their mendicant insolence, had become an
insupportable burden. So, in despair, in 1328 the
Church, as we have said, delivered fifty of them to the
secular arm, and these were burned, as an example,
in Cologne. The persecution was now steadfast and
continuous; but still in secret places, and by strange
underground channels, the <a id='corr37.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='panthiest'>pantheist</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_37.17'><ins class='correction' title='panthiest'>pantheist</ins></a></span> idea spread on
unseen—pantheism which now was no longer vague
and veiled. “<em>We do not believe in God, and we do
not love Him, and we do not adore Him, and we do not
hope in Him, for this would be to avow that He is other
than ourselves.</em>” Thus speak these heretics of the
fourteenth century. So far have they pushed the
phrase, God is all that exists.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this time the cohesive force of Beguinism
rapidly diminishes. In 1365 Pope Urban V. still
speaks of the “children of Belial, Beghards and
Beguines,” but their name slips gradually out of the
chronicles of edicts and of councils. Or it is applied
to any new sect of heretics. In 1373 we hear of
“the Beghards or Turlupins,” and in the next
century Beghard is frequently synonymous with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Lollard. The great heresy of the Free Spirit was
divided into a hundred unimportant divisions. By
the middle of the fifteenth century, <a id='corr38.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='The'>the</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_38.3'><ins class='correction' title='The'>the</ins></a></span> Beghards and
Beguines were either orthodox communities of some
tertiary order, or scattered hermits, living in woods
and forests, and stealthily keeping red the few embers
left of pantheistic heresy. It seemed as if the movement
were really stamped out. But the phrase of
Mechtild was not so easily confuted. No man can
burn an idea.</p>

<p class='c006'>We hear no more, it is true, of the Beguines or of
the Weaving Brothers; but in the sixteenth century,
when at Wittenberg and at Strasburg, at Basle and at
Meaux, the great idea of the Reformation simultaneously
awoke, in that period of spiritual ferment,
the pantheism of the secular fraternities flamed out
again, and more fiercely than before. The libertines,
the anabaptists, and familists of the sixteenth century
preserved in a coarser form the persecuted tradition
of the Beghards and the Beguines.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>The great ideals of the world save themselves by
strange disguises. Though the advance of progress
threaten their existence, none the less they perpetuate
themselves in unsuspected shelter. If to-day
we see religion mask itself as devotion to humanity,
it is but the reversal of the great masquerade of the
Middle Ages, when whatever impulse of good-will to
man was destined to survive assumed for safety’s sake
the garb of the Church. Benevolence, science, logic,
philosophy, and all the arts put on the hood and cowl.
And the time came when love also entered religion.
Indeed, the convent was the one safe place of refuge
in a struggling, dark, chaotic world—a world for
which centuries of careful nurture had ill-fitted the
sentiment of love. The Middle Ages had existed,
one might say, for its development. During the
century succeeding the invention of the Immaculate
Conception (1134), the cultus of the Virgin became
dominant in the Church, and, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>pari passu</em></span>, the position
of women grew nobler in the world—was, indeed,
elevated and spiritualized to a dangerous artificial
beauty. Then a thousand devices were discovered to
hide from the yet imperfect man and woman the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>brutality of the one and the meanness of the other.
The Courts of Love, where no husband might be the
lover of his wife, the gross and strained devotion of
the minnesingers, the worship of Mary and the saints,
were expedients unreal or ugly in themselves, but
they imposed on mere brutish passion a beautiful
sentiment of reverence and service. For they showed
the woman beloved as a creature aloof and apart,
separated from the disenchantment of possession by
the distance of heaven or the barriers of earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus through the Middle Ages love grew and
flourished; a plant delicate yet and scarcely acclimatised,
but watered and tendered and sheltered. Without
this care it could not grow, being still young and
not well-rooted. Then in the thirteenth century a
terrible convulsion disturbed the world, and the fate
of all tender, exquisite things hung for a while in
awful balance. For in that eventful century, which
rounds the old world and begins the new, the long-gathering
jealousy of pope and emperor burst into a
fearful storm. The tempest of over twenty years
which destroyed the empire of the house of Hohenstaufen
left Rome, though victorious, none the less a
prey to her own champion, Charles of Anjou. For
three years he would not suffer the election of a pope,
holding the keys of Peter in his unrelaxing clutches;
and even when the papal see was nominally filled,
the Angevine adventurer guided its counsels and
prompted its decrees. One shipwreck engulfed both
papacy and empire, nor could any foresee that from
those wrecks far nobler vessels should be built. The
hierarchic and feudal order of things had fallen, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the spirit of law and federation was yet unknown.
All over Europe spread darkness and confusion:
Rome was paralysed, France crazed with superstition
and communistic panic, Italy a mere disorganised
prey for the next comer; and Germany, most piteous
of all, with the convert’s earnestness and the loyalty
of a serf, not yet fit for the sudden withdrawal of the
hierarchy and the feudalism to which she clung for
support, Germany reeled heavily. It seemed that the
end of the world was at hand; and truly, in this
terrible interregnum, the whole fabric of the Middle
Ages began to crack and gape in ominous ruin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now that the Courts of Love were wasted, his
tournaments battle-fields, his minstrels shouting
battle-cries, what had become of Love? Where should
his ladies, sung so long and honoured, look for their
knights? They are gone to fight for God and the
king; they are gone far away, but no longer to the
Holy Sepulchre; they are gone to ravage and ruin
distant cities, or to lay low the power of Rome.
Many never return; some after years—ten, fifteen,
twenty years—come home again, tanned and grey—swearing
troopers, whose talk is all of battle, whose
camp jests and lewd stories fall like filth into the pure
fountain of a woman’s soul. What knight is this for
a delicate lady to love! She must change the very
nature of her love if this shall satisfy her heart.
The frail ideal, nourished so long with care and
patience, must die, so it seems. But, as in ancient
legends, where the lustful lover pursues a pure nymph,
gaining hold upon her, stretching out his hands for
the prize, to find them empty, to find her out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>reach, safe in the inviolable greenness of the laurel,
even so the tender spirit of love, with one violent
effort, set itself beyond the lusts of the imbruted
world, sheltered, transformed into the mystical love of
God.</p>

<p class='c006'>A natural impulse was given to religion by the
divisions and disasters of society. We have shown by
what channels the mystical spirit of Alexandria permeated
the religion of the West. The knight from his
captors or his captives, the scholar from his studies, the
monk from his perusal of the most popular of saintly
authors, might all become imbued with a like spirit.
Throughout the West there spread, partially, indeed,
and not to all alike, a scorn of science and understanding,
and a sense of mystery, an aspiration to
ecstasy, a desire to merge all personality in the infinite.
Such influences did not create, they did but
direct the movement. They were—as M. Vacherot
has shown us—a source of inspiration, a reserve of
tradition for a natural instinct which, even without
them, must have satisfied itself. Owing partly to
these semi-religious influences, partly to the external
condition of affairs, the movement—which might
have established another School of Alexandria, might
have believed in astrology or the philosopher’s stone,
might have merely ended in jugglery and witchcraft—instead
of this became a school for visionaries and
ecstatics. How strong the movement was may be
inferred by the length of its duration, and by our
finding in its ranks not merely hysteric virgin saints,
not merely the two priors of St. Victor, not merely
the poetic Suso, the fervid Ruysbrock, the contemplative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Tauler, but the wide intellect of Albertus
Magnus, the strength of Eckhart, the practical wisdom
of Gerson.</p>

<p class='c006'>The doctrines of Neoplatonism, received through
the medium of a saint, were translated into another
sense by men of less intellect and stronger affections
than the Alexandrines. Science is little to these later
mystics, the inward spring of peace is much; they
question with Bonaventura not doctrine but desire,
not the human mind but heavenly grace. Not light
they ask, but fire. By ecstasy they seek to unite
themselves not only with the abstract wisdom, but
with a supreme love. For ecstasy is to them the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ars
amandi</em></span>, and to them the one thing needful not intelligence,
but feeling. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Amor oculus est,”</span> says Richard
of Saint Victor, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“et amare videre est.”</span> To behold
with this eye the things that are hidden from earthly
vision; to die to the world, in order to live to Christ;
to lose one’s soul; to drown self, conscience, reason,
virtue, feeling, in a flood of ecstasy, this had become
the ambition of the nobler spirits of the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this apotheosis of ecstasy, this contagion of love,
the feminine element naturally predominated. The
movement, which the gracious and pathetic figure of
Elizabeth of Hungary announced, was to be, above all,
a movement of women. Far beyond the glory of
Eckhart and Gerson, above the eminence of thinker
and teacher, shone, in this strange hierarchy of
dreamers, the beatitude of the visionary and prophetess.
Prophets of God some, others prophets of
evil; so the Church decided. But it is hard to divide
the spiritual abnegation of Bridget, of Catherine, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the two German Elizabeths, of Mechtild of Magdeburg,
Gertrude and Mechtild von Hackeborn, from
the heresy which declared that to the soul lost in God
the sins of the body are as naught. That heresy is
but the others’ holiness, pushed to its logical consequence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The saints were chiefly women—women of vague,
imperious, unsatisfied emotion, sick of a world given
over to rapine, interdict, and slaughter, where no
choice was left between disloyalty and damnation;
women young and active, living for the most part the
passive, temperate eventless life of the convent;
women who imposed on themselves long fasts and
vigils, whose tender flesh was bruised with the stone
flags of the cell where they would lie of winter nights
for penance, and torn with the lashings of the self-inflicted
scourge. In this life no hope for them; in
this world no love, no happiness, no possessions. As
starving people dream of delicious feasts and banquets,
they found in a vision the things withheld from them
awake.</p>

<p class='c006'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Amor rapit, unit, satisfacit</em></span>: the practical Gerson
lets fall the fiery phrase. Each of these virgin
visionaries had said as much. Open the books of
their exercises, their revelations; the dusty pages
exhale a violence and tenderness of passion that the
minnesingers never caught, the troubadors never felt,
in their earthly singing. For these saintly visions
are all of love—love which ravishes; nay, love which
drowns, annihilates, swallows up. Love in a dream,
and yet the one real thing in a cramped and narrow
life; love which fills every interstice and cranny of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>void and aching heart; love unseen, untouched, unheard,
for which the visionary waits hour by hour, in
an anguish of tense devotion, waits till the muttered
monotony of her prayers, the fixed, unvaried straining
of her eyes, shall have lulled the body to a death-like
trance, shall set free the soul to show her the mirage
of her own unsatisfied desire.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>I.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Throughout the thirteenth century Thuringia continued
the centre and stronghold of German sanctity.
The life of St. Elizabeth at the Wartburg had gone up
from its midst like a purifying altar-flame to heaven.
When she died in 1231, hundreds of men and women
came in tears to honour the wasted body wrapped in
its worn Franciscan cloak, lying dead in the poor
little house at Marburg. From the memory of her
life, from the pilgrimages to her tomb, a tradition and
ideal of saintliness spread among the people. Fifteen
years later, it was in Thuringia that the Pope found
his champion. Even his oppression, and the defeat
and death of that ill-starred defender of the faith did
little to abate the popular ardour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The convent of Rodardesdorf, near Eisleben, and
the great princely convent of Quedlinburg, gave an
especial religious distinction to Thuringia; but not
until about the year 1234, when the rich and noble
Freiherr von Hackeborn of Helfta placed at Rodardesdorf
his little five-year-old daughter Gertrude, was
the specially illustrious future of that house decided.
Rodardesdorf was a convent of Cistercians, a thoughtful
and peaceful place. The little Gertrude was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>happy there. She was a serious and earnest child,
“not content,” says the chronicle, “with childish
innocence, but, even when a babe, gifted with a constant
gravity and prudence of demeanour.” Indeed,
that childish head was troubled with many things, for
the little girl was passionately eager to learn all that
came in her way: science, liberal arts, grammar,
theology. So that she became no less honoured for
her acquirements than beloved for her docility and
modesty of bearing.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the convent was to acquire another infant saint.
The mother of Gertrude again visited the convent, and
on one occasion brought with her her younger
daughter, Mechtild, then seven years of age, and as
many years younger than her sister. “They came
for honest diversion,” says the chronicle, probably to
see little Gertrude, and certainly with no thought of
leaving Mechtild behind. But the child was so
delighted with the strange place, the large rooms, the
little cells, the chapel with its altar lights, the children
in the garden, the nuns who made much of her, that
she declared she would willingly remain there for
ever. Nor would she leave, though her mother bade
her come. Then the sisters, delighted with so much
holiness so young, instantly beseeched the mother to
leave her little girl in their company for awhile, and
to this she consented. Poor mother, did no pang go
through her heart when the convent doors shut on
both her children? It was for ever; no prayers, no
commands could bring her back her wilful, loving,
eager little Mechtild any more, for the <cite>Vita</cite> relates,
“after this holy and blessed embrace her parents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>could never withdraw her from that place for all the
caresses and endearments that they knew how to
make.” With bruised ties and bleeding hearts the
career of saintliness begins. “Only he,” runs the
Scripture that child would often hear, “that hateth
father and mother can become my disciple.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the daily routine of life in the convent we may
gain an idea from Abelard’s directions to the nuns of
the Paraclete, and, setting against the difference of
date the difference of culture in the two countries, we
may not unfairly suppose the Thuringian Cistercians
of 1250 to have followed much the same rule of life
as the Benedictines of Heloise adopted a century
earlier.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to the code of Abelard the convent was
divided into six functions, all alike subject to the
direction of the abbess. The sacristan was responsible
for the convent treasury; she kept the keys,
and had the care of the church plate and sacred
vessels; and it was her duty to set the virgin sisters
to prepare the wafers for the Host, which must not be
made by widows. The chantress taught singing and
reading, had care of the choir and of the library, to
which she was expected to add by copying and illuminating
manuscripts. The head of the infirmary
had charge of the sick. Another sister was mistress
of the wardrobe, and responsible not only for all the
spinning, weaving, and sewing necessary for the convent,
but also for the tanning and cobbling. The
cellarer had in her charge the wines for the altar and
the sick, the provisioning of the table, and the
management of whatever the convent possessed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>orchards and garden-land, flocks and herds and hives,
trout streams and mills. Lastly, the doorkeeper,
who was especially chosen for courteous manners,
judgment, and trustworthiness, was responsible for
the keeping of the gate, the entertainment of guests,
and the distribution of hospitality.</p>

<p class='c006'>Life in the convent was not hard, but monotonous,
eventless beyond description—a perpetual alternation
of broken sleep, repeated tasks, and prayer. In the
middle of the night the sisters rose for Matins, and
the office over, trooped back through the darkness to
the dormitory. There they slept till Lauds, which
are sung at the break of day; in summer, when
Lauds are early, the sisters slept again till Prime.
At Prime they left the dormitory, having first washed
their hands, and taking their books repaired to the
cloister to read and sing until the office should
begin. Service over, they all assembled in the
chapter-house, where a lesson out of the Martyrology
was read to them and expounded. On leaving the
chapter each nun was sent to fulfil her allotted task—singing
or sewing, nursing or baking—until the hour
of Tierce, when mass was said. They then resumed
their work till noon, the sixth hour, which was the
convent dinner-time, except on fast-days, when it was
postponed till Nones, or in Lent, when nothing was
eaten till after Vespers at four. The convent fare
was simple and spare. Save for the sick, no wine;
stale bread of coarse flour; roots and greens, and at
discretion of the abbess a portion of unflavoured meat
on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. From the
autumn equinox till Easter, on account of the shortness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of the days, this one meal was considered sufficient
for all save the infirm.</p>

<p class='c006'>After dinner, in summer-time, the sisters slept till
Nones; in the two hours between that office and
Vespers they were set to finish their task, but at four
the day’s work was done. Between the spring and
autumn equinoxes the sisters were permitted a light
refreshment after Vespers. It was the only time
when fruit might be eaten. This light supper over,
Compline began. Then they all sought the dormitory
again. On Saturday evenings they were a little later,
as then the sisters were enjoined to purify themselves—that
is to say, to wash their hands and feet, a
function which the abbess or lay-sisters were specially
directed to supervise. This done, they slept till the
midnight matin-bell should clang them from their
beds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Out of such a life of dreary monotony, the same
task day by day, or another exactly like it, the same
prayer, the same lesson, always of saints and martyrs;
out of this life of forced privation, this half-starved
life of chants and broken dreams, who can wonder
that (Μορφή μία) visions, mysteries, scandals, witchcraft
continually arose. The two little children prospered
in the convent which was at first merely a
school for them, and an excellent school. Gertrude,
the silent, studious, ambitious scholar, found there
more books and better teachers than she could have
had at home; and, so long as her soul was set on
learning and studying, the homage paid her as a
child set apart for God only served as a spur to her
ambition. “She ever would increase her natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>beauty of soul by saintly customs, adding to it the
splendour and the sweetness of all manner of
flowered virtues, so that she should be more pleasing
in the eyes of every one,” says the chronicle in which
after her death the nuns of Helfta embalmed her
virtues. But while little Gertrude laboured so hard
to make herself desirable, Mechtild, quite simply and
without effort, won all hearts to herself. Although
she was not so learned nor so grave as her sister,
though once she had told a lie (the one lie of her
life), boasting to her companions that she had seen a
thief in the court, where thief was none; though,
judging from a later vision, she had sometimes looked
back from the plough and longed for her mother’s
love: ay, though no early holiness had, as with
Gertrude, foretold the saint, and only after her
entrance to the convent had manifested itself in her;
despite all this, Mechtild was the loved one. While
Gertrude in the library was toiling hard at grammar
that her mind might be worthy of God and the love
of her companions, Mechtild standing in the garden
was surrounded with listeners, hanging on the words
of her fanciful allegories as she expounded the message
of God. While Gertrude was making extracts
from the Fathers and compiling treasuries of Scripture
to help the souls of the sisterhood, Mechtild, like a
little mother, was going among the sick, speaking,
ministering to each, giving help and comfort to all in
affliction. As they grew older it was still the same—Gertrude
putting her soul into her studies, Mechtild
into her life; Gertrude absorbed and wise, with no
one friend preferred to any other; Mechtild every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>one’s darling, beset with every one’s confidences “to
the impediment of the sweet quiet of her soul.”
Gertrude the humanist, Mechtild the human.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>II.</h3>

<p class='c016'>So far all was right and fair. Each child naturally
selected the education fitted to its wants, and became
wise or loving as the need was. But when they came
to full girlhood they did not quit this school whose
teaching they had outgrown. These girls were, since
their childhood, cloistered nuns dedicated to God.
But only when their childhood was over could they
appreciate the meaning of their vow. To Mechtild it
did not greatly matter; her life in the world might
have been fuller and richer, in the convent it was not
wasted. She was so easily interested in others, so
gifted to soothe the sick and suffering, so naturally
humble and unselfish, that even the consciousness of
sanctity could not injure her nature; in her visions,
even, she rarely announces her own glory. It is Gertrude
that she sees in the bosom of the Father, and she
hears the Divine Voice proclaim, “Gertrude is far
greater than this Mechtild.” More often her visions
are messages of consolation to those she has pitied
and laboured for awake. She sees the dead baby of a
certain sorrowing mother clad in scarlet and gold, and
greatly glorified in heaven. She beholds God and the
Virgin standing by the bed of one of the sisters who
is sick unto death; or else her visions are tender and
poetic fancies. She sees the Father giving all the
saints to drink of the Fountain of Mercy. She sees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>the Heart of God burning like a lamp; or, again,
she beholds the sacred rose that blooms in the Heart
of God; or, lastly, her visions supply the needs of
her maimed and stinted life. Kneeling on the floor
of her cell, this loving woman, with no natural ties,
often sees God come to her as a little child of five
years old, and, in a dream, God gives her His love, at
last, to be her mother, “to care for her and lead her
as a mother her child.” Or she dreams, this woman
with her love of colour and beauty, of beautiful
women in splendid raiment. Mary comes to her in a
gown the colour of air, sewn all over with tiny flowers
of gold, and embroidered round the neck and sleeves
with the holy monogram of Jesus. Or she comes in
a pale green cloak, latticed over with gold, with the
head of Christ in every lattice. St. Catherine of
Alexandria appears in dull crimson, covered over with
gold embroidery of little wheels, fastened at the
breast with a clasp of two meeting hands of gold.
Christ appears young and beautiful, in rose-coloured
silk, stiff with gold and jewels, “yet not to be thrown
away because so heavy, but rather ennobled,” as the
soul with the heavy gems of grief. Or she sees the
least saint in Paradise, a youth of middle height,
wonderfully lovely, most fair of face, his hair crisply
curling, of a colour between green and white, clad all
in green. Never, out of Meister Stefan’s pictures,
were there such deep colours, such quaintly-patterned
gowns and mantles, such jewels and embroideries as
figure in the visions of this poor little sallow saint,
asleep herself in her darned serge and yellowed linen,
and always clad, by her own choice, in the worst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>clothes of the convent, torn and patched in all
corners.</p>

<p class='c006'>The real dangers of mysticism have little power
over a soul so sweet and naïve as this. But it was
otherwise with Gertrude. She was a woman of
passionate intensity of imagination, of an ever-active
and ambitious mind. During her childhood this had
been wisely exercised in study. Had she gone then
into the world life and learning would have employed
it for her. Had she been a secular sister like
Catherine of Siena, a wandering preacher and
prophetess, like Mechtild of Magdeburg, or an
avowedly learned and reforming abbess, like Heloise
or Teresa, she would, perhaps, have been most useful
and happiest of all. But, when she grew up, when
she perceived the real aim of her cloistered life, her
learning became odious to her. What had the vain
lore of this world to do with the appointed spouse of
Christ? “While this virgin was continuing the study
of the humanities,” relates the <cite>Vita</cite>, “she became
aware that this study was a region too remote from
the similitude of Christ, perceiving that too hungrily
she had longed after human learning, for which
reason she had not until that moment disposed her
heart to receive Divine illumination. She knew then
(and not without passionate sighs coming from the
heart) that until this time she had been deprived both
of the consolations and of the illuminations of Divine
wisdom, since she had remained intent on human
things.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A terrible conflict, a terrible temptation. With
Gertrude’s earnest nature there could be but one end.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>She cut off from her the hungry and passionate love
of human learning as she would have cut off a limb
or plucked out an eye to enter, maimed but holy, into
Paradise. With tears, and anguish, and bitter agony
of prayer, she maimed her soul. But not always does
the mutilated member heal. Woe to those whom
nature punishes for their temerity with mortification,
with numb and creeping death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now that Gertrude had, of her own will, shut off
from herself all her former means of progress and
employment, how should she spend her time? She
was not, like Mechtild, by nature a sick-nurse and a
confidant; she had not, like Mechtild, a beautiful
voice which she could cultivate for the service of
God; and to her dominant eager nature it was necessary
to do something and to do it better than any one
else. The one remnant of all her studies which she
permitted herself was the translation of Latin prayers
into German for the benefit of more ignorant sisters,
and at this she would persevere the whole day long.
But this oft-repeated, almost mechanical employment
could not fill her mind, could open no vista to her
ambition. There was, indeed, only one road that
she could follow; all the circumstances of her life
converged to the same vanishing point.</p>

<p class='c006'>When she remembered, in the long vacant hours of
sleeping or copying, the books she used to read, what
thoughts would they naturally suggest to her? She
had, we may be sure, read no books that would give
her visions of the world outside—poems of Virgil the
magician, or the minnesingers. To her the humanities
were themselves books of theology; the writings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>of the fathers of the Church, a tract of St. Bonaventura’s
it may be, or one of the sermons of Eckhart or
of Albertus Magnus (then at the prime of their renown),
certainly the works of Dionysius Areopagita.
What would they have taught her, these books which
she had given up to imitate the lowliness of Christ?
They told her, one and all, how much more desirable
was feeling than reason, ecstasy than care for others,
faith than works; how far above all natural tenderness
of human charity was the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>virtus infusa</em></span>, the
theological virtue, the love of God. Every hour of
her life must have repeated the lesson. The eight
offices of the day, the lesson from the <cite>Martyrology</cite>,
which was all the food this hungry and active mind
was given to fast upon; the daily task of copying
prayers; the long, weary misery of being no one, in
no true position. All these things must have spoken
to this earnest, self-preoccupied Gertrude, who had
toiled so long to make herself pleasing in the eyes of
every one; and, now, knowing so well what was
necessary, would she not strive in prayer for this
last, dearest gift? Would she not set herself to learn
this one thing needful? Most likely she had not long
to pray, nor ever consciously began to learn, before
the gift was granted, the science acquired, the strong
mind weakened and perverted, the student an ecstatic.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>III.</h3>

<p class='c016'>From that first moment of vision the fame of Gertrude
grew so high and so rapidly, that when in 1251
the abbess of Rodardesdorf expired, this girl-ecstatic
of nineteen was elected her successor. It is strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>that the duties of her new position, the great responsibilities
of so famous a convent, did not draw her from
her visions; but the influence of the time was strong,
and the abbess of Rodardesdorf was beset by no imperious
need for reform. There was no cleansing work
of righteousness to be performed in that well-ordered
house of high-born mystical ladies. All that Gertrude
could do was, seven years after her nomination,
when the springs of Rodardesdorf dried up, to remove
the convent to her own castle of Helfta, an act which
naturally increased her own position in the convent,
and tripled her glory of abbess, benefactress, and
ecstatic. Gertrude, however, was not the only saint
in Helfta. Besides her sister, the sweet, fanciful
Saint Mechtild, there was Gertrude the Nun,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a> sometimes
confounded with the abbess, who in all probability
wrote the concluding book of the <cite>Vita</cite>, certainly
finished after St. Gertrude’s death. The two daughters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of the Count of Mansfeld were also professed in the
convent, and were gifted disciples of its mystical
doctrines. Sophia spent her life in enriching the
already valuable library of Helfta, and Elizabeth
painted, probably in the chapel.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1265 the convent, already the high school of
ecstasy in the north of Germany, received a more
famous woman than any of these. This was our
Mechtild of Magdeburg, whose earnest faith and
flashing, passionate eloquence, whose songs inspired
with a wild, strange tenderness, whose life of hardship
and adventure for the love of Christ, had rendered her
one of the noblest and most endearing figures of her
age. She chose Helfta to be the home of her declining
years, and added another glory to the convent of St.
Gertrude and St. Mechtild.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such a house, it may be supposed, did not exhaust
the spiritual energies of a nature so full of force and
so ambitious as that of its young abbess. Her surroundings
were but an added incentive to her aspiring
soul. She worked hard, it is true, aided by her sister
Mechtild. Every day she visited the infirmary and
saw that the sick were well and cleanly treated. She
ruled her nuns with thought and care; but when the
hours of leisure came, the many daily periods set
apart for prayer and meditation, then her old ecstasy
overpowered her with a strength and vividness the more
forcible for the obstacles it had to overcome. More
passionate, more personal become her revelations as
she lies abandoned to trance and vision in the arms
of the spiritual Lover. So strong, so hot, so fierce,
so tender are the words that fall from her lips, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>we cannot bear them now unmoved. Ah me! what
vain and fruitless passion this dreaming love of
the saint for a dream!</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not until nine years after the bestowal of the
“singular grace of divine familiarity,” says the <cite>Vita</cite>
that Gertrude wrote down the description of her
visions. But the visions, themselves recorded in the
five books of her revelations, seem to have begun
almost immediately after her renunciation of human
learning. “From that time she began to hold as
vile all visible and external things, and verily not
without a cause, for from that time the Lord opened
to her the ways of Mount Zion, a place of joy and
consolation. Leaving the study of grammar, in which
she was greatly instructed, she turned to theology,
that is to say, Holy Scripture and the lives of the
saints, using them with infinite diligence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And soon the saint herself began to speak from the
mount, in her own language. None of the tender
consolations and quaintly pictured fancies of Mechtild
are here. The revelations of Gertrude manifest
the ambition, the activity, the emotion of a
crushed and passionate nature forced into an unnatural
channel. Tragic and miserable spectacle:
the strong passion, the earnest will so sorely wanted
in the world outside, are spent vainly, vilely, in
inducing terrible disease. The saint grows weaker
as her visions increase in force; her mind, warped
and broken, can bend but one way. And that way
is towards inertia, madness, and annihilation. An old
tale, oft-repeated, yet needed, perhaps, in these days of
mesmerism and spiritual <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>séances</em></span>. An old tale, well-known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>to the Yogis of India, to the monks and nuns of
mediæval Europe, to all who have deliberately made
themselves the victims of catalepsy and hysteria.
For deliberately they did it. Many of the receipts
have come down to us: the absolute cessation from
practical affairs, the emptiness of mind and heart;
the regulated diet, neither too little nor too much;
the lack of sleep; the quiet, which no joy or woe of
others may disturb, when, seated or kneeling in his
cell, at an hour when digestion is well over, sighing
lugubriously in deep, regular sighs, the eyes are fixed
on one point too high or too low for perfect comfort,
the arms are to beat the breast in monotonous
routine, as Gerson and other mystical doctors prescribe,
until a heavy trance involves the body, until
the brain becomes deranged by this appalling and
stultifying monotony, and creeping death or madness
end the vision.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It happened once,” says the <cite>Vita</cite>, “that by reason
of sickness, Gertrude was prevented from attending
vespers; and, longing for these, and feeling sick at
heart, she turned to the Lord, and said:  ‘O my
Master, were it not more praiseworthy that I should
now be singing in the choir with my other companions
and hearing the prayers and the other regular
exercises than to be lying in this weakness, in which
I consume in negligence so many <a id='corr59.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='hours?'>hours?’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_59.27'><ins class='correction' title='hours?'>hours?’</ins></a></span> To which
He answered: ‘Oh, dost thou believe the bridegroom
holds his bride less dear, when he stayeth at home to
taste the familiarity of his domestic pleasure, than
when he glories to lead her forth, well adorned, before
the gaze of the crowd?’ from which speech she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>understood that, in the divine service, the soul
appears as a bride going forth; but, when heavily
laden with bodily infirmities, then as a bride sleeping
in the secret chamber; for the more that man is
weak, shorn of all pleasures of the sense, destitute
and impotent, the more is he made to delight the
Lord.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Such a theory was naturally productive of fasts and
vigils, nor, if the favour of her Lord depended on the
sickness of her body, could it ever have been far from
this poor ailing and anæmic girl. A revolting amount
of suffering is naïvely and incidentally revealed in her
works of spiritual grace. Scarce a chapter but opens,
“Being again sorely weak from want of sustenance,”
“Lying again in bed helpless with sickness,” “Being
sorely oppressed with a burning of the liver,” or with
some similar avowal of the connection between her
revelations and the weakness of her health. Often
she piteously implores the Lord to restore her to her
former soundness and well-being, but the answer is
always the same. “Thy sickness is a dance and a
festival for me,” responds the Celestial Spouse; nor
ever is there any hope given her of a cessation to her
pain. In her wandering senses the poor tormented
saint dimly guessed that her spiritual gifts were dependent
on the utter prostration of her body and her
mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>The spectacle of her suffering convinced the whole
convent of Gertrude’s sanctity. They believed her in
daily communication with their unseen Head. It was
natural, therefore, that they should bring their sorrows
to her and entreat her intercession, as men ask
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>a minister to counsel the king, or a steward to remedy
the carelessness of the absent master, or a favoured
mistress to beg that, for her love’s sake, a piece of
justice may be granted that otherwise were withheld.
It was natural, also, that Gertrude should believe
herself capable of guiding the will of God; natural
that the strange vanity of the visionary and the
hysteric should obscure the eyes of her mind, and
lead her further on the road she had chosen. After
visions, miracles.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Miracles exist in the mind of the witnesses. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Le
miracle,”</span> said Lamennais, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“existe quand on y croit.”</span>
To the latter-day sceptic, the marvels which procured
the canonization of Gertrude are such natural trifles
that it is difficult to imagine they could ever have
filled a whole countryside with rapture and <a id='corr61.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='thanksgiing'>thanksgiving</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_61.17'><ins class='correction' title='thanksgiing'>thanksgiving</ins></a></span>.
A sudden downfall of rain, the ceasing of a
shower, the finding of a needle—such are her
miracles. But hear with what pomp and circumstance
the chronicler narrates them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One evening when the nuns had finished supper,
they went into the court to finish a certain piece of
work that they were set to do, and it happened that
at this time the sun still shone, notwithstanding that
in the sky there were several clouds which threatened
rain; wherefore she, sighing, began heartily to converse
with the Lord, I hearing all she said, as follows:
‘O Lord God, Creator of everything, I do not wish
that thou, as if compelled, should obey the will of
me unworthy; none the less would it be very dear to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>me, if pleasing to Thee, if Thy most liberal goodness
shouldst prevail against Thine honest justice to retard
a little, for my sake, this rain. None the less, Thy
will be done.’ She said these latter words resigning
herself into the hands of God, not thinking of aught
but the fulfilment of His good pleasure; a marvellous
thing it must certainly be accounted, that scarcely
had she finished speaking when lightning, thunder,
and great drops of rain burst forth with great fury;
for which cause, moved with pity for the other sisters,
she remained altogether filled with fear, and again
she said to the Lord, ‘Let Thy goodness, O most
clement God, last at least so long as while we finish
our appointed task.’ At these words the most
clement God, to show how in everything He was
pleased to grant her prayer, held up the rain until
the nuns had finished the task they were at work
upon; which done, they returned to the convent, and
scarcely had they reached the gate when there began
a tempest of rain and thunder and lightning, so
that some of the sisters who had lingered behind
could not enter the door before they were soaked to
the skin.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>V.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Gertrude was the saint of the convent, and yet her
ambition cannot have been wholly realized. She,
who ever since her childhood had laboured hard to
acquire “all manner of flowered virtues in order to
please the eyes of every one,” she, the favoured of
God, was nevertheless in the convent less beloved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>than simple Mechtild. The fact is revealed unconsciously
in every page of her life, in all the numerous
revelations when God declares that notwithstanding
the convent’s suffrage, Gertrude is greater than
Mechtild. And greater she was—more passionate,
strong, and earnest, suffering anguish and burning
with great desires that her sweet and happy sister
could not conceive. Love was necessary to her, love
and approbation. They were the very food of her
soul. Reading side by side her revelations and her
life, one easily comprehends how in proportion as she
failed to gain the love and tenderness of her companions,
her visions become erotic and passionate.
To give such a nature respect, esteem, awe, as a
reward for its sacrifice, is in bitterest truth to give a
stone to the child crying for bread. Gertrude being
hungry dreamed of a feast; phantasmal banquets
which nourish not, but madden.</p>

<p class='c006'>As time went on, Gertrude transferred all her
earnestness, all her powers of feeling, from the outer
world to this dream-born inner life. Censorious,
abstracted, caring little for physical suffering, she
was tender and anxious to the last degree in all
matters that concerned the soul. And this without
any interest in the personality of the creature she
longed to save. She had, says her biographer, not
one friend so dear that to save her she would by so
much as one word commit an offence against perfect
justice, and would declare that rather would she
consent to the injury of her own mother than harbour
an evil thought against an enemy. Her conversation
was in heaven, and the things of the world were as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>dust to her. Nay, as poison. She was as careful
as Pascal<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a> by no word of hers ever to draw to herself
the heart of any person; it was not for her who was
beloved of God to unite herself in earthly friendship,
and as one would fly a person stricken with a pestilent
disease, she fled from any one who sought her affection.
Never now could she endure to hear a word of
earthly love; rather would she remain deprived of
the services and the goodwill of all the world than
ever consent that, by reason of human favour the
heart of any should be joined to hers.</p>

<p class='c006'>So says the chronicle. Yet with all this bitter indifference,
this love turned sour in her heart, she
kept a great tenderness for erring or tormented souls,
praying and watching for them, warning and consoling;
and though the sinner proved obdurate, not
yet would she relax her care; nay, when the sisters
besought her not to afflict herself for the sins of the
<a id='corr64.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ungoldly'>ungodly</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_64.19'><ins class='correction' title='ungoldly'>ungodly</ins></a></span>, she would answer that she would rather
suffer death than console herself for the misery of
those who would only understand their own perdition
when at last they should stand in face of the eternal
expiation. So great was her compassion, that did she
only hear of any one sick in spirit, be he never so far
away, she could not rest without endeavouring to
console his sorrow. And as men laid low with fever
exist from day to day in the hope of recovery, watching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>themselves to see if they are not a little better,
so she longed and watched from hour to hour that the
Lord might console the mourner and ease him in his
affliction.</p>

<p class='c006'>Strange and pathetic this zeal for the indefinable
and impersonal soul, concerning itself nowise with
character or feeling, with mind or physical well-being.
Strange and awful this transmuted love, this transformed
humanity and kindness, which deal with unrealities
while all around a world sickens and dies.
Yet not so strange if we remember that to exchange
the reality for the shadow, the thought for the dream,
and truth for a phantasm, is the principle of mysticism.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VI.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Meanwhile Mechtild, a mystic by doctrine and circumstance,
but not by temperament, concerned herself,
even in the convent, chiefly with the affairs of
reality. She was, as we have seen, every one’s friend,
nurse, and confidant, and but slenderly concerned
with saintly glories for herself. She never wrought
any miracles, nor did God ever tell her that she was
His most favoured among women. It was Gertrude’s
glory that she declared. The saintly acts that are
recorded of her have a pathetic human grotesqueness
never to be found in Gertrude’s doings or sayings.
For instance, out of a great pity for the sins of the
mummers and dancers at carnival, she filled her bed
full of potsherds and broken glass, and rolled in them
till she was a mass of cuts and sores, begging God to
accept her suffering as a set-off to the merry-making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>of the world outside. This is not the true mystical
temper, which ignores all but the union of the soul
with God. Mechtild sought no advancement for her
own soul, she sought to palliate the offences of the
guilty and to save them from punishment rather than
bring them to repentance; moreover she felt herself
responsible for their errors. The true ecstatic, lost
in God, abjures human responsibility. Nevertheless,
even in the convent, Mechtild, with her merry patience
in suffering, her care for the sick body no less than
the sick soul, her humility and lovingness, was naturally
dearer than her austere, abstracted sister-saint.
And, none the less, the sisterhood was aware that
Gertrude not Mechtild was their real title to honour.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the mystical life spread like a contagion through
the convent, many of the younger sisters, underfed,
deprived of air and exercise, had not strength to
support the abnormal existence of the visionary.
Sickness was frequent in this convent of ecstatics,
and whether at Rodardesdorf or at Helfta its mortality
was excessive. The nuns died young of undefined
diseases. We are always meeting allusions to their
short, dream-visited lives, to their early and inexplicable
dying. They perish of anæmia, before the
acknowledgedly consumptive sisters; and the nuns can
find no reason for their death unless it be that God
was anxious to remove so much sweetness to flourish
perpetually in His presence. The diseases of the
convent are such physical ills as are induced by
mental strain and by bodily inanition—consumption,
hysteric convulsions, or paralysis, disturbances of the
liver. Such as cannot die—such as, like Gertrude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>herself, have too strong a fibre to perish in girlhood—linger,
tormented by sickness, prematurely old and
useless. All they have to console them is the phrase,
vouchsafed by her heavenly bridegroom to Gertrude
in vision, “Lo! ye that fain would hasten into my
presence, ye are as a spouse that bare and unadorned
would venture into the nuptial chamber; know, that
after this death which ye so much desire, no further
grace can accrue to the soul, nor can it suffer any
more for God’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mechtild of Magdeburg, Dante’s Matilda, was the
first of the greater saints to succumb. A long life of
hardship, of energetic striving with a guilty world,
years of Beguine Prophecy, much labour of writing
and preaching, and the pain of bodily weariness, had
worn her out. At the age of sixty-seven the strongest
and sweetest of all the German women-mystics departed
from a world which she had not shrunk to
face, which even from her cloister she had striven to
ennoble. The strong, reforming spirit was stilled at
last. The one woman in the convent of Helfta who
knew the world as it is, its sins and aspirations, its
generosities and crimes, was dead. A window was
shut in that house, a window showing the world
beyond the chapel walls, and letting in upon the
heavy smell of flickering candles and swinging censers
the free breath of the wind. Henceforth there was
no reminder of the larger world, the purer air outside:
Mechtild of Magdeburg was dead.</p>

<p class='c016'>No such release was appointed for Gertrude; the
easy death of the body was not for her, though for
death she prayed by day and by night, finding that
her prayers for health and strength were never
granted. Nailed to her mattress by exceeding weakness,
she watched the younger nuns die, one by one,
“admitted to the celestial marriage-chambers,” while
she, faint, palsied, useless, lingered on. “O, my
God,” she cries, “could I not serve Thee better with
my old strength than thus?” And ever the soul-heard
answer comes, that the more humbled the
body, the poorer the proud intellect of man, so
much the dearer to God is his spiritual essence.
Thus dragged on year after year, and the great
abbess filled her five books of revelations and
her eight books of spiritual exercises. Her life was
spent and she was old. The later hagiographers
relate of Saint Gertrude that she died of a languor
of Divine love. Modern science would call by another
name this long palsy of the body through the prostration
of the mind. But no diagnosis, saintly or
scientific, can add to the sense of misery and waste
with which we recall that strong life so early broken,
those twenty-five years of strained nerves and aching
limbs, that six-months-long daily death of hysterical
paralysis.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This elect of God,” relates the <cite>Vita</cite>, “full of the
Holy Spirit and worthy to be embraced by the arms
of Divine charity, Gertrude, most benign abbess, all-praiseworthy,
having laboured for forty years and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>many days in the honour and praise of God, ruling
her abbey wisely and with much prudence, sweetly,
and with much discretion, being by reason of all
these virtues flowery as a fresh rose in this world, and
marvellously gracious and worthy to be loved, not
by God only, but by mankind as well, at last, after
forty years and forty days, fell into a grievous sickness,
which is known as minor palsy, a form of
apoplexy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The narrators of the life, who knew Gertrude and
had often seen her, say no word, it will be perceived,
of the celestial love-sickness which a more sentimental
taste gave out afterwards to be the cause of her death.
And, indeed, such a superstition could not rise, even
round so great a saint, while the physical details of
her last weakness remained fresh in the minds of the
nuns of Helfta. They mourned her truly, and believed
that never a holier saint had been translated
to those pleasant fields of heavenly green for which
she had so often longed. But, with an admirable
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>naïveté</em></span>, even while they believed that God had drawn
her miraculously from her sick bed into His arms, they
knew that she had died of palsy. To them there was
nothing incongruous in the two ideas; they had no
thought of concealing—they would rather display—the
degradations and infirmities of the mere human
body which had so long enchained the heavenly soul.
At first her senses remained to her, only she could
not move her limbs, could not stir the wasted hands
that once had been so swift to sew, to write, to put in
order whatever was out of place. She could lie still
and dream, the poor, dying mystic.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>For she had given to her now, as a gift that should
not be taken away, that perfect quiescence and
immobility of body which she had practised so
often, so patiently, by day and night, in times
gone past. And soon she was to be granted that
other wing of ecstasy, complete abstraction of the
mind from all human thoughts and affairs. So
heavy became the burden of her infirmity that she
could no longer order the affairs of the household,
no longer care for others. At last she could not
speak, she could not pray, she could not think. She
was perfected in the mystical way; annihilated,
stultified, palsied, she had attained the summit of
her desire. Never moving, never changing, dead-alive,
she lay there month by month, a helpless burden
upon the community. Worshipped as one indeed
highly favoured of the Lord by those whose feet were
all set on the same sterile and deadly road, she could
give utterance to no other words but these, “My
soul!” And this phrase she repeated over and over
again, finding it marvellously ample and sufficient to
express all the movements of the spirit. O pitiless
ideal, O cruel and revolting doctrine, is it to this you
would reduce the living, thinking, active human
mind? Is the end of such continued sacrifice, such
years of hourly, daily labour nothing but this—a
palsied useless body, a dumb, numb soul, with no
thought and no desire beyond itself? At length
the hour of dissolution was at hand, the night
in which no man shall work; and in waiting for this
the days of life had gone by fruitless and wasted; in
hoping for this the sun had risen and set in vain, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>seasons had changed unnoticed; in preparation for
this soul and heart and mind and physical powers
had deliberately hamstrung their noblest faculties;
and now the long-awaited night was at hand, the night
in which all mistakes are forgotten, all cares and
anguish set at rest.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last time that Gertrude spoke these two all-sufficing
words, “My soul!” was one evening when
Compline was at an end. Then began her passage
to the other life. At this time, fables the author of
the end of the <cite>Vita</cite>, in quaint allegorical eulogy, not
only the chamber of the dying abbess, but the whole
of the monastery, was crowded and thronged to excess,
since among the praying and weeping sisterhood knelt
all the virgin company of heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At length the happy hour was come when the
Celestial and Imperial Spouse should receive His
beloved in His house of love, finally, after so
much longing, set free of the prison of the world.”
The nuns knelt round praying and weeping; the
watching sisters saw angels kneeling too. And we,
do we not see the ghosts of stillborn pity, and joy,
and love, and help, standing white-eyed and shadowy
there? Yet wherefore should all or any weep? The
end is at hand; the labour is over and gone, and soon
she will rest so well that, even if she could, she would
not quit her quiet bed. Well may she sleep, poor,
troubled soul, mistaken and most noble in its errors;
well may she sleep who, being dead, yet speaks with
a clearer and surer voice than she spoke with on
earth, telling of patience and sacrifice borne willingly
for love’s sake, of faithful endurance through pain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>and toil, teaching an example and a warning in one
word. And in the middle of their praying none heard
at what moment the sleeping spirit went. The
abbess was dead; but the convent went on as though
she had been still alive. Another abbess took her
place; another nun saw visions and worked miracles
in her stead, a lesser saint but of the same quality.
Even after Mechtild’s death some years after, the old
life went on—the old routine of sleep and prayer, or
of forced wakeful nights and baneful ecstasy; and
the old life of insufficient food and insufficient thought
begot the old aberrations and diseases. The fever
had not yet run its course.</p>

<p class='c006'>We standing here, safe, as we imagine, from the
deadly epidemic, curiously studying these eight hundred
closely printed pages as records of morbid
hysteria, may feel our hearts melt with a melancholy
regret for the shipwreck of so many noble lives. For
the worst of this malady was that it attacked the
loftiest spirits, as phylloxera the oldest and most
fruitful vines. We may pity and praise them in a
breath; we may give a kindly wonder to their belated
love and say that, but for them, the sentiments that
fills our hearts to-day would have been less patient,
less tender, less exalted. And this is well, that we
should honour the best in them. But let us take
care that we ourselves are free and whole; let us not
deem ourselves too safe, but place a quarantine on
our own souls lest the sweet and fatal poison of
mysticism penetrate thither unawares.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c015'>I.</h3>

<p class='c016'>As an island is surrounded by water, as night surrounds
the stars, and air the globe, so beyond the
region of the known there stretches an illimitable
space of darkness and of silence. All minds know
that it is there; to many of us it is a background of
repose to the busy scene of life; to some the hidden
tract has its chart of faith or dogma. But there are
others to whom that vast and dark Unknown is more
present than the small and shining certainty of the
Universe. They are sucked into the eddy of its vastness
and its darkness. These natures turn from the
substance to dream of the shadow, they leave the
narrow fields of science and go out boldly over those
unsounded waters beyond. Souls such as these are
never quite at home in life: the dark, the undreamed
of, the infinite has enchanted them. They are drawn
by the attraction of the Abyss.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c006'>Mysticism allures different men by different
methods. It draws by various lines the passionate
heart, the broken and humbled will, the heated fancy,
the indignant spirit wroth at the hardness and evil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>of the world. It draws no less the reasoning and
metaphysical mind, repelled by dogma and yet desirous
of the Deity. For Mysticism is not only an
affair of dreams, of miracles, and visions, it is not
only a satisfaction to disordered imaginations, to
diseased and stunted passions; it includes a system
of philosophy so logical that who accepts the first
easy thesis arrives without negation or amazement
at the last. The Mystics have, in fact, made a science
of the soul, an elaborate system of abstractions, quite
logical in itself, although in contradiction to the
truths of physical nature. No one, indeed, is readier
to admit this contradiction than the Mystic himself,
for the soul, he says, is exactly the contrary of the
body. It is therefore natural that as bodily life rises
in the scale from simple to complex, so the soul’s
existence should be purest when least differentiate.
For the soul and the body meet on one level for a
moment, but they come from different positions. The
human body is the highest evolution of the animate
world; the human soul, the Mystics assure us, is the
lowest and last descent of Infinite Being. In fact, the
soul of man is to Divinity in the same relation as the
zoophyte is to us. Only, unfortunately for the simile,
in this strange supernatural cosmos the zoophyte is
higher than the man. Let us rather say that man,
having progressed from the zoophyte to humanity in
body, must now in soul ascend from the man to the
zoophyte. For the soul, we must remember, is
divinest when most simple. It is the last descent
of God, and God (the Mystics say) is absolute unity
and simplicity. “God,” says Meister Eckhart, “is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the simplest essence of existence; and who, thinking
of God, sees any distinction from utter simplicity,
be sure he seeth not God.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>II.</h3>

<p class='c016'>“But how” (we can imagine one of Eckhart’s
audience exclaiming), “how can the absolutely simple
be the manifold? God, you say, is the Simple and
the One; and yet you say that every soul descends
from God. If God is absolutely simple and single,
He cannot divide Himself into many souls.” Eckhart
here, we may be sure, would smile and praise the
discretion of his assailant; for this objection brings
us to the central theory of Speculative Mysticism, the
dearest dogma of Plotinus, of Dionysius, of Scotus
Erigena, as of Master Eckhart.</p>

<p class='c006'>Spirit is everywhere one. Spirit is in the Godhead
and indivisible. The Godhead exists, our Mystics tell
us, above and beyond all Divine theophanies; the
Godhead exists as a vast and unfathomable ocean,
rolling its seas of emptiness and silence from pole to
pole. But everywhere the ocean is bordered by the
land; and its waters, in the circle of their tides,
wash over a hundred shores, and fill a thousand bays
and creeks and little rocky pools. Even as the deep
sea sends its shallower waters over the sands, and
then withdraws them into its eternal and unfathomable
fulness, so the waters of God flow into every
soul. And when the sea withdraws its tide, it withdraws
not merely the contents of this pool and
yonder creek, but the sea itself, eternally undivided,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>though for the space of a tide it filled the limits and
the hollows of the shore.</p>

<p class='c006'>But not all the strand, is washed by the sea; above
a certain line the sands grow their rank, stiff grass,
and grey-green thistles; the sands are almost land.
And not the whole of the soul is visited by the Divine
simplicity; only the water-line, the arid depth of the
soul, is swept over and filled by the infinite being of
God. “There is something in the soul,” taught
Meister Eckhart, “uncreated and uncreatable; there
is something in the soul which is beyond the soul,
Divine, simple, an utter nothingness; there is a
place in the soul where God inhabits, and this base
of the soul is one with the base of God. And to reach
this obscure retreat of the Eternal and Divine, where
the unconscious Godhead dwells—this is the supreme
and final goal of all created things.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>III.</h3>

<p class='c016'>And how shall the Mystic reach this obscure and
inner depth, this silence where the soul is one with
God? By sinking into himself. For the Mystic there
exists no exterior world. Since God is within us,
what value is there in the world without? <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Omnes
creaturæ sunt purum nihil,”</span> formulates Master Eckhart.
For the Mystic the body is only a prison, a
distortion, a hindrance; its senses, its experience
cannot teach him. “Being freed from the folly of
the body,” said Plato, “we shall of ourselves know
the whole real essence.” “Matter,” says Plotinus,
“is the principle of individuation, and who would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>seek the one must quit the things of matter.” Without
the body, then, we were no longer personal, no
longer separate; we were all One and all God. It is
the body which determines our character; there is no
personality in the soul. We must conceive it as pure
water poured into a coloured vase, which becomes red,
or blue, or green, according to the colour of the vase.
The colour is not a principle of the water, and does
not affect the water. So the soul poured into the
body appears to take a note and colour of its own,
but, poured out again, is seen to be unaltered. The
first aim of the true Mystic is to purify his spirit from
this extraneous and earthly tint; to make the vase,
if he can, as colourless, as simple and uniform as
that infinite Being, of which, in Erigena’s phrase, the
Soul is the last descent.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since the soul is God the world is nothing. No
more than the eye can taste or the ear handle, can
the created comprehend the Divine. “If we are to
know anything purely,” we read again in Plato, “we
must be separate from the body.” And Plotinus adds
that he who enters in quest of the One must ascend
to the First Principle of his own nature. The First
Principle of Plotinus is the same as Meister Eckhart’s
Foundation of the Soul. It is the One. Intellect
may be a means to reach it, but it is certainly
not an end. The Mystic philosopher thinks himself
into an ecstasy; and the ecstasy, not the thought, is
his goal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our Mystic has therefore abandoned the world, and
abandoned his own experience in the endeavour to
attain to God. He must be quite still, passive, dumb;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the mystic should be as a new-born child who has
not yet smiled in his mother’s face. He must not even
<em>will</em> to be made one with God. “He must have no
seeking for himself more than has a corpse,” writes
Eckhart. “Let him be as one dead,” counsels Suso.
“He must not be satisfied with any deed or virtue,”
adds the Flemish Ruysbroch, “but only in the Abyss.”
And Tauler rises to a passionate eloquence: “Sink
thou into thy Depth and thy Nothingness, and let the
tower and all its bells fall down upon thee; yea, let
all the devils in Hell storm out upon thee; let Heaven
and Earth with all their creatures assail thee, yet
shall they all but marvellously serve thee.... Sink
thou only into thy Nothingness, and the better part
is thine.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Death in life is the aim of the Mystic, and his
consolation is the thought of his annihilation. There
is not any rest for him, and no solace save in that
which Suso calls “the desolate wilderness and deep
chasm of unsearchable Deity.” To us of a later
age to whom the greatest and most alluring promise
of religion is the hope of Personal Immortality,
it is hard to realize a fact which must strike
every student; namely, that throughout the Middle
Ages the most passionate motive of a hundred passionate
sects, the dearest thesis of the deepest
thinkers in the Church, was this intense desire of
personal annihilation. As a fact, this frenzy after
Nothingness cost the Church more heresies than any
corruption in herself. The very doctors of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Church were tainted with it. The lowest of the
people—poor, starved, and hunted fanatics—formed
themselves into bands and brotherhoods to preach
this comforting gospel of extinction. The books of
Dionysius the Areopagite carried the Alexandrian
theories of the One into every monastery in Europe.
The Almaricians, the Vaudois, the followers of Ortlieb,
the Beguines, the brothers and sisters of the Free
Spirit, and many other sects of poor and wandering
people, spread their fantastic corruptions of the
same, throughout the working classes. From the
twelfth to the sixteenth centuries, the desire of many
a mystical saint was identical with the despair of
atheists to-day. It was the extinction of the personal
soul. The whirligig of time brings strange revenges.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mysticism throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries occupied, in the thinking and religious
world, a position almost identical with that of
Spiritualism in our day. Like its modern offshoot,
mediæval Mysticism could be superimposed on any
cult or habit; like Spiritualism, it lent itself equally
to a grossly sensual, or an abstract and idealist interpretation.
And Mysticism, therefore, appealed to an
immense audience; to the ignorant and pretentious,
dissatisfied with the Church’s authority, merely because
it was authority; to the pure reformers, anxious
to preserve religion and quit the formal and corrupted
shows of it; to tender, pious, and dreaming
souls, with no great hold upon the world of fact;
to the abstract reasoner, eager to preserve his faith
while letting untenable dogma slip away. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>authorized religion occupied a singular position
towards these Mystics, who formed, as it were, a
Church within the Church. Afraid to quite disown
them or, indeed, to openly disapprove, lest she might
thereby weaken her own hold, yet conscious all the
while that these theories of her children were scarcely
less subversive of her own supremacy than those of
any heretic or atheist, the Church burnt one Mystic
and canonized another, with an impartiality born of
vacillation. The influence of the Mystics was indeed
immense, and too serious to be lightly regarded.
They promised to destroy the prison, the canker,
the disease of <em>Self</em>—to let the freed soul loose from
the body, to vanish for ever in the Divine darkness of
the unimaginable Abyss; they made the comfort of
many a dreaming soul, tortured by the ineradicable
memory of human sin. They offered to the tired
thinker, the starved and weary labourer, the broken
nun, the harassed townspeople, an attraction which
the Church herself dared not openly afford; and many
who had wandered away from the hard-and-fast,
strict-and-narrow fold of Rome, found a refuge in
Mysticism, who might else have thrown aside all
claim to faith. Even as to-day, many are Spiritualists
who otherwise would certainly be Agnostics. For
Spiritualism insists on none of the bonds or dogmas
of religion, and offers a palpable proof to its believers
of that which religion only promises; that is to say,
the Immortality of the Soul, that golden mirage-fountain
of our thirsty modern world. This was
precisely the position of mediæval Mysticism, only,
as we know, it was Rest, not Life, that she offered;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>extinction, and not continuance; not Paradise, but
the Abyss.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>V.</h3>

<p class='c016'>That a great many people everywhere at one time
ardently desire one thing is certainly no proof that
their desire shall be satisfied; but it shows a real
want in the heart of man—a want which may be
stopped by altered conditions, if not by the actual
things desired. As many people longed for extinction
in the harassed Middle Ages as pine for immortality
to-day. I do not mean to say they formulated
this desire, for most of them were fervent Christians.
But life was bitter then, and they hoped to extinguish
their weary and craving souls in the unconscious
Godhead. When life is bitter now, we say “Eternal
Justice owes us a happier experience to discharge
our sufferings here.” But in both attitudes the
same one fact remains, that so long as life is bitter,
men will crave and will complain. No modern
preacher has spoken more fervently of the joys of
immortality than these medieval Mystics spoke of
the Abyss. Each to each has been the final and immeasurable
recompense for all the wrongs that ever
there were in the world. By many ardent Churchmen,
and many saints, and many thinkers in the
Middle Ages, God was chiefly worshipped as the
Abyss. He was the Supreme Annihilation. The
soul must plunge, says Eckhart, into pure
Nothingness. The soul must sink, says Tauler,
in the Divine Darkness, into the secret place of the
Divine Abyss. “There is no safety,” says Guillame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Briçonnet, “save in the Abyss” (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“l’abysme
qui abysme en désabysmant”</span>). Adventitious reward,
says Suso, may come in the consciousness
of having conquered evil and done good; but true
reward, essential reward, is only in the wild waste
and deep abyss of inscrutable Deity, in the union of
the soul with sheer impersonal Godhead. This
Godhead, says Eckhart, is a simple stillness
without quality or distinction. God is neither this
nor that. Who can distinguish and say, “This is good,
sees not God; for all that is in the Godhead is absolutely
one, and formless, and void, and interminable,
and passive.” And the names under which God is
chiefly worshipped show this strange impersonal attitude.
The Divine Dark, the Obscure Night, the
Desert, the Abyss, the Unimaged Nakedness, the
Infinite Essence, the Hidden Darkness, the One, the
Supreme Nothing: these are the names of this remote,
abstract Jehovah of the mediæval Mystics.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VI.</h3>

<p class='c016'>To lose themselves in this unconscious <a id='corr82.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='beautitude'>beatitude</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_82.21'><ins class='correction' title='beautitude'>beatitude</ins></a></span>
was the religious ideal of a thousand souls. To
lose themselves, to drown, extinguish, break through
and beyond the hateful imprisoning Ego—this was
the motive of their mood. But what, we may ask,
remains of a man after he has lost himself so utterly?
How can he distinguish the bliss of which he dreams?
How can he even know he is resting? We are suspicious
that these Mystics did not quite realize their
own desires, that they meant some residue of themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>to remain and enjoy the sensation of their own
Nirvana. And so we ask of them what they mean by
the Abyss. “Thereof,” says Eckhart, “we cannot
speak. It is the simplest essence of existence, it
is unknown, and must ever be unknown. It is the
simple darkness of the silent waste. It is the utmost
term.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But yet we are unsatisfied and persist in questioning.
How can the spirit of man, deprived of virtue,
cognition, will, personality and life, remain immortal?
Still more, how can he enjoy such immortality?
The dim feeling of such eternal rest we all can understand,
who have gone suddenly from a lighted room
into the vast night, and have felt our souls suddenly
invaded and possessed by a sense of mystery and
silence. We have felt this; but in his final beatitude
the Mystic must not feel: “He must be as one
dead.” We also can understand the dizzy rapture
of unwinding abstraction from abstraction, till we
weave a net that seems to hold the heaven and all
its stars. But the Mystic may not think. “He must
see neither distinction nor difference.” And the passionate
upward spring of the soul towards a God,
unseen, unknown, in which it still believes; thus
might we pray. But the Mystic does not pray. “So
long as a man desires to do the will of God, so long
he is not truly fit; he who may seek the Godhead, he
neither wills, nor knows, nor cares.”</p>

<p class='c006'>What then, we ask again, what is the satisfaction
that draws your souls so firmly towards the Abyss?
Will no one answer? And Tauler, the great Mystical
Dominican, replies, “There remains to a man, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>fathomless annihilation of himself; and an absolute
ignoring of his personal self—of all aims, of all will,
heart, purpose, use, or way.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VII.</h3>

<p class='c016'>It is not, then, a personal delight that awaits the
Mystic in the abyss; it is the sense of absorption in
his Deity. It is hard to define the character of this
Godhead for which the man so gladly lays down his
soul and his life. Since it is identical with the foundation
of the soul (and this, Eckhart assures us, is not
only Divine and simple, but an Utter Nothingness),
it is difficult to lay hold of the idea of its divinity—or
indeed of its difference from created matter which is
also <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>purum Nihil</em></span>, and it is easy to see how, by this path
of negation, Mysticism always diverges into Pantheism....
The essence of the Mystical Divinity
appears to be its very incomprehensibility; and it
would be rash and vain indeed to form an idea
thereof. But we may at least attempt to understand
what that divinity appeared to its worshippers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The One,” begins Plotinus, “is neither substance,
nor quality, nor reason, nor soul, neither moving, nor
at rest, not in place and not in time; neither is it of
any sort or kind.” Thus we learn what things were
not intrinsic to the Deity; we learn that we must
conceive a bodiless, unqualified, impersonal, interminable
Void; an eternal, undifferentiate essence of
existence; an infinite Being not to be approached by
reason or by soul. Eckhart goes a step further, and
affirms not only what the Godhead is not, but even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>what it is. “There is a Godhead,” he says, “above
God. The Godhead neither moves nor works.... It
is a simple Stillness, an eternal Silence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>If this were all we might comprehend the longing
for quiet, the passionate desire for rest which made
the wearied and the trouble-harried of all times deify
silence and repose. Mysticism has ever flourished
best in starved or stormy ages. It is the shrinking
of the soul from a perplexed and hideous outer life;
it is in some the desire for love and peace, in some
the desire for rest, in some for immortality elsewhere.
But in logical and speculative minds it is more than
this; the God of the Speculative Mystics is not merely
Sleep, not merely Dreams, not merely Stillness. They
carry their reasoning fearlessly to its natural conclusion,
and this is worthy of all praise in them; but
that they should worship that conclusion is surely
strange—for “God is non-being,” writes Scotus
Erigena; and, Eckhart adds that when the soul penetrates
the pure uncreate essence of the Godhead, then
Nothingness is at last in the presence of Nothingness.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VIII.</h3>

<p class='c016'>God, then, is Nothing; Erigena has given us the
phrase, for <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Nihilum</em></span>, he says, is the infinite essence of
God. The soul is Nothing; “a fathomless annihilation
of self,” in Tauler’s words, “an utter nothingness,”
in Eckhart’s sentence. And, lastly, the world
is nothing, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>purum Nihil</em></span>, and as unreal as the rest.
Already, in the close of the twelfth century, David of
Dinant had declared that Everything is at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>time Spirit, Matter, and God. The later Mystics added
a new line to his Thesis: All is One and All is Nothing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the result of this strange Idealism, which
sacrifices from first to last the idea of personality to
the conception of God. These are the dogma of this
singular phase of thought and feeling; a phase which
unites all that is cold and formal in philosophy with
all that is unreasoning, perfervid, and hysterical in a
Religious Revival. The doctors and preachers of
Speculative Mysticism, have trances no less real than
those of Saint Francis; but what they contemplate
with rapture is not the idea of Infinite Love. It is
Infinite Nothing which fills them with ecstasy.
And these Mystical thinkers are as precise and as
liable to become the mere pedants of a system, as any
follower of Kant or Comte. And yet, though they
seek to use only their reason, they despise reason.
These philosophers look upon reason as the humble
handmaiden of ecstasy. And that divine ecstasy is
excited by the thought of a Nihilum.</p>

<p class='c006'>This indeed appears almost an absurd position;
and yet the position of the Mystics was honourable
and intelligent. They attempted to answer questions
which even to-day the theologians elude (see Newman,
“Grammar of Assent,” p. 210). “Whence comes
Evil?” Evil, they reply, is not created by God, but,
so to speak, the blanks and spaces not filled up by
His creation. Evil and pain have no Real Existence;
they are but a deficiency of vitality; they are negative
and temporary qualities unrecognized by an
unconscious God innocent of inflicting them. “Why
are we created responsible beings without our own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>consent?” Our bodies are not created by God and
we are not responsible to Him for their errors. They
are the expressions of our Eternal souls—their own
expressions at their own desire as a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>modus vivendi</em></span>
in the world. “How can God need our action if He
is omnipotent? If omnipotent, how tolerant of Evil?
If permitting suffering, sin, and Hell, how then All-loving?
If All-loving, how Just?” These questions
are all answered by the mystical conception of God as
a Divine Passivity, an unconscious Fund of Existence.
All that is impossible and absurd in the theories of
the Mystics is caused by adapting them to religious
ideas. They had to explain the immortality of the
soul, ... and they spoke of eternal absorption into
an Infinite Nothing. They had to explain a good
and omnipotent God creating an evil and impotent
humanity. They made the one nothing and the other
nothing.</p>

  <h2 id='chap4' class='c004'><span class='sc'>The Schism.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In the year 1377 the Pope was at Avignon. Seventy
years ago a Pope had come there, as the guest of the
Count of Provence, in order to arrange with the King
of France the iniquitous extermination of the Templars.
He had come to Avignon in the hour of Papal
triumph; for in the tragic ruin of the Hohenstaufens,
the prestige of the empire was destroyed at last. But
in reality this fatal victory had left the Pope no longer
the arbiter between France and Germany, but the
dependent of the sole surviving Power. The attraction
of successful France drew the Pope from Rome
to Avignon.</p>

<p class='c006'>At Rome the Pope had left his Vatican, his authority,
his tradition. At Avignon, a chance guest, hastily
lodged in the Dominican monastery, he was little
better than the Political Agent of Philippe-le-Bel.
Yet he showed no hurry to return. Clement was a
Frenchman of the South, a Gascon, at home in
Provence but cruelly expatriated among the dissensions,
the enthusiasms, the treacheries of foreign Italy.
Year after year found him still at Avignon, and there
he died in the year 1315. His successor, John XXI.
or XXII., was another Gascon; and Benedict XII.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>(1334-1342) and Clement VI. (1342-1352) were
Frenchmen also. They built a mighty palace at
Avignon, immense, with huge square towers, and
walls—four metres thick—scarce broken by the
rare small pointed windows rearing their colossal
strength high into the air. The great golden-brown
palace was less of a palace than a prison, less of a
cloister than a castle. It was, in fact, a baron’s
fortress of the feudal age; for the Pope had almost
forgotten that he was Pope of Rome; he was the
Count of Venaissin and Avignon.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was rich; he was a great lord; he lived
luxuriously within those frowning gates. His rooms
were full of money-brokers, weighing and counting
out their heaps of gold; and there arose no Christ to
drive them from the Temple. France, England,
Germany, Italy, groaned in vain beneath the exactions
of the unscrupulous financial ability that furnished
the Court of Avignon with its soft living, its
delicate manners, its attention to the Arts. In the
beautiful house upon whose walls Simone Memmi had
painted a host of his sweet and melancholy angels,
men forgot the trumpet clang of the name of Hildebrand;
and when the officers of Clement VI. dared to
remonstrate with him upon the Oriental magnificence
of his palace, deprecating an expenditure beyond that
of any of his predecessors—“None of my predecessors
knew how to be a Pope,” replied the Count of
Venaissin. The Papal ideal had changed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet it would be wrong to regard the Popes at
Avignon as Oriental satraps dreaming away, among
enchanted reveries, a life of luxury. They were above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>all things French and very French; active, keen,
humane, with a genius for prosperity, a natural quickness
for organization. They had a practical piety,
of which they made a good income, not without an
honest expenditure of pains. Their missions were
established in Egypt, India, China, Nubia, Abyssinia,
Barbary, and Morocco. Yet, though so eager to convert
the heathen, they kept no rancour in their hearts
against the unconverted. Cruel they were sometimes,
for their age was cruel, but often they were
amazingly humane. John XXII. launched Bull after
Bull in defence of the unhappy Jews, massacred by
Christian greed, and the perverted pity of Christian
superstition. “As Jews they are Jews, as men they
are men,” said the Pope. “Abhor their doctrines,
respect their lives and their wealth.” And Clement VI.,
when France and Germany tortured and expelled the
abominated nation, threw open wide the gates of
Avignon, and at the knees of the Vicar of Christ, he
made a momentary sanctuary for the Wandering Jew.</p>

<p class='c006'>Clement was followed by Innocent VI., another
Frenchman, equally content with Avignon. When he
died it was nearly sixty years since any Pope had
trodden the holy stones of Rome. But his successor,
Urban V., for all his Gallic blood, revolted against
the position of St. Peter as chaplain to the King of
France. He saw that the Church lands in Italy were
slipping continually from the Pope’s control, while
Papal vicars established themselves as hereditary
masters of their fiefs, and city after city declared
itself with impunity no longer the vassal of St. Peter,
but a free Republic.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>In Germany the doctrines of Marsiglio and Occam
had enduringly ruined the prestige of the Pope. For
they declared the Bishop of Rome a simple bishop, subject
to the law, subject to the Council, subject to deposition
at the hands of the faithful; his thunders were
pronounced illegitimate and harmless since no priest,
but only a Council General, could excommunicate or
even interdict a nation or a king. In Germany the
Reformation had begun, as it was to continue, upon the
lines of theory and dogma; in England it was already
a political revolt, a declaration of national independence.
In 1365 England refused to pay the tribute of
1,000 marks which John had promised to the Pope as
to his lawful suzerain. England at that moment was
triumphant. Ten years ago the battle of Poictiers had
secured her hold on France. The French king had
died a captive in the Savoy in London, and Europe
was not yet aware that the new king of France was
Charles the Wise.</p>

<p class='c006'>At that moment, indeed, France, in reality so near
the top of the wheel of fortune, appeared at her lowest.
Nations and men forget how quick that wheel
revolves; and the Pope, beholding France his sole
protector against the world, and France the prey of
England, felt himself no longer safe at Avignon. In
1361 a company of freebooters had defeated the Papal
troops at the very gates of the Papal city; the Pope
had bought them off with a ransom, and had redoubled
the fortifications. But he had realized his
insecurity. It was evident that the real interests of
the Church demanded the return of the Pope to
Rome.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Urban made a courageous, a heroic effort. He
dragged his reluctant Court of luxurious French Cardinals
across the seas to Rome. But in that black and
savage haunt of robbers, the Pope remembered
Avignon too well. He came home at Christmas time
in 1379; but it was only to die in the beautiful
familiar palace; and, out of France, the faithful
called his death the judgment of the Lord upon him
who looks back from the plough.</p>

<p class='c006'>A brighter epoch opened for his successor, Gregory
XI. The genius of King Charles and his brothers,
the Dukes of Anjou and Burgundy, had restored the
fortunes of France; and Anjou, at any rate, was
aware of the advantage which the House of France
might reap from the partnership of a Pope at Avignon.
For the Pope, of course, was a Frenchman and
willing to assist in the triumph of his country,
a triumph he could best assist by remaining at
Avignon to further and inspire the policy of his king.
Every tie, indeed, united to detain Gregory in
Provence. He was no ascetic, indifferent to glory
or to comfort; but an affectionate, natural man,
loving his ease, loving his family, loving the land
where he was born. At Avignon he dwelt among
his friends, his kinsmen, his father the Comte de
Beaufort, his mother, his four sisters. The stories of
his Cardinals could only add to his own horror of that
distant Italy whose language he could not speak.
He was ill, and he dreaded the miasma of Rome; he
needed the comforts of that Court whose luxurious
memory should long survive in France. “You should
have come to Europe a few years ago, before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Schism,” writes the anonymous author of Maître
Jehan de Meun—</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet it was Gregory the Eleventh who was to restore
the Papacy to Rome.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was no longer so easy to return as it had
been in the days of Urban. That Pope had not
removed to Rome until the energy of Gil Albornoz
had reduced the princes of Italy into submission. But
now Albornoz was dead, and Italy was more than ever
tumultuous and discordant, for the French Governors
whom Urban had left behind him had filled the Papal
states with horror of the French Pope. Petrarch also
was dead, whose pen no less than the sword of
Albornoz had been a potent instrument for the return
of Urban. The times were changed, and Italy, who
had mourned so long the Papal tiara fallen from her
forehead, was no longer willing to receive it. After
seventy years of exile the Papacy had become a
foreign power, and by many of the Italian princes the
restoration of Gregory seemed little less than a French
invasion. Of all the Papal states only Orvieto, Ancona,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Cesano, and Jesi remained true to him. Florence, of
old so faithful to the Church, was now united against
her with the Ghibelline Viscontis of Milan; and the
Arch-Guelf clasped with a mailed hand her new
crimson banner written in golden letters with the one
word <em>Libertas</em>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Italians seemed as capable of shaking off the
Pope as they had been capable of shaking off the
Emperor. Only a few voices still lamented the exile
of St. Peter. Gregory knew very well that the return
to Rome meant strife and bitterness, and that he
must re-enter his dominions bringing in his hand not
peace, but a sword. This prospect inspired him with
disgust and fatigue; while every principle of habit,
affection, patriotism, loyalty, and selfish interest conspired
to keep him in Avignon. All this in one scale;
but there lay in the other the conscience of the Pope
and the voice that inspired that conscience. It was
the voice of a young Italian nun. Europe, distracted
with wars, perplexed, unguided, heard at last
one voice that proclaimed the will of God, and
acknowledged her conscience in St. Catherine of Siena.</p>

<p class='c006'>The letters of St. Catherine came frequently to
Avignon, and with them came other letters from the
French Governors telling of the increasing difficulty
of keeping together the little that was left of the
patrimony of St. Peter. Gregory became visibly disturbed.
His conscience urged him to return to Rome.
In July the Duke of Anjou<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a> came to Avignon to
dissuade the Pope from an enterprise so disastrous,
as he believed, to the future of France. Of all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>royal princes Anjou was the one specially concerned
with Italian policy. He was a man handsome, impressive,
with a breadth of view and a force of ambition
that made him many followers. This son of St. Louis
could not fail to influence the Pope. He made it
harder to go from Avignon; but the persuading voice of
Catherine would not be stilled. The Pope was ill
and afraid, a timid man; his sisters and his parents
clung to him, entreating him to stay; his Cardinals
opposed him; his king commanded: yet on the 13th
of September he quitted Avignon. Evil omens added
to the discouragement of his spirit; his horse stumbled
under him at starting, and fearful tempests delayed
him on the sea. But on January 17, 1377, the Pope
re-entered Rome.</p>

<p class='c006'>The seventy years which had made the beauty of
Avignon had ruined Rome. No longer the pilgrims
brought her the custom of foreign countries; the Court
of the Vatican no longer gave an impetus to trade;
the prestige of the Pope had ceased to make of Rome
the centre of Europe; and the deserted city had
realized her intrinsic poverty. Thirty years ago
Rienzi had proclaimed her a cave of robbers rather
than the abode of decent men. The churches were
in ruins,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a> many of them wholly roofless; and in St.
Peter’s and the Lateran the flocks nibbled the grass
of the pavement up to the steps of the altar. Row
after row of ruined dwelling-places gave way to wild
fields and heaths—scars of desolation upon the depopulated
enclosure of Aurelian. If mediæval Rome
lay in ruins, the Rome of antiquity was yet more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>ruthlessly destroyed, and the temples and theatres of
the pagans were used as a quarry or a limekiln by
their savage and impoverished successors. For with
prosperity, peace and order had deserted Rome. The
fierce clans of Colonna and Orsini terrorized the
starved and fever-stricken populace; and there was
no law beyond their tyranny. Murder was frequent,
vendetta an honoured custom, and the Eternal City
the shambles of unpunished bloodshedding.</p>

<p class='c006'>In such a place decency, quiet, or even safety were
naturally strangers. The Cardinals, unwilling martyrs,
mourned day and night for Avignon. The Pope himself
became disenchanted, ungentle, and embittered.
But he was resolved not to quit this odious Italy until
the patrimony of St. Peter was regained. Albornoz
was dead, it is true; but in the Cardinal of the Twelve
Apostles the Pope found a spirit no less militant,
resolute and cruel to lead his armies against the
revolted cities and to re-establish in Italy the vanished
prestige of Rome.</p>

<p class='c006'>Robert of Geneva, Cardinal of the Twelve Apostles,
was, like the Pope himself, a Frenchman of good
family and aristocratic prejudice. His father was
the Count of Geneva, his mother Mahault of Auvergne
and Boulogne. In his eyes the revolt of subjects
was a crime beyond excuse; and when, as in the
present case, there was added to the denial of the
divine right of sovereigns a heretic apostasy from the
dominion of the Church, his indignation dried the
founts of pity in his heart. The history of his whole
life proves the Cardinal to be not naturally cruel, nor
even vindictive; but his campaign in Italy was terrible.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>With the Frenchman’s distrust of the Italians, Robert
refused to engage Italian condottieri; he knew
that these companies, changing masters continually,
were gentle to the enemy of the moment, the brother-in-arms
of yesterday and to-morrow. The Cardinal,
fiercely in earnest, engaged the Breton Jehan de
Malestroit who had cried, “Where the sun can enter,
I can enter!” and the Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood,
with his White Company the most terrible of
the day. Supported by these pitiless auxiliaries,
Robert of Geneva quenched in blood the fierce resistance
of Florence, Bologna, Cesena, Faenza, and
other rebellious cities. Massacre after massacre, sack
and pillage innumerable marked his progress; but
the voice of the Churchman was never heard to cry
for mercy. He had no admiration for the obstinate
courage of the besieged; they were rebels, and beyond
pity. “I will wash my hands in their blood!” he cried
at Bologna and at Cesena there were 5,000 slain.
These things made the name of the young Cardinal
an abomination in Italy. But they secured in one
campaign the submission of the Italians.</p>

<p class='c006'>The laurels of Robert of Geneva still were green
when, on March 27, 1378, Gregory the Eleventh died
at Anagni. The Pope had been on the point of
returning to Avignon; and the necessity of their prolonged
residence in savage Rome, and the fact that
the Conclave must be held there, fell with the weight
of misfortune upon the impatient Cardinals.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was the first Conclave that had been held in
Rome for fifty-seven years, and the Roman populace
clamoured in the streets for a Roman Pope. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>among the sixteen Cardinals of the Conclave, eleven
were French. They might easily have carried the
necessary majority of two-thirds had they been of
one mind among themselves; but the hatred of North
and South did not merely divide the French from the
Italians; it divided the Frenchmen among themselves.
Gregory and Clement had both been Limousins, and
the majority of the French Cardinals decided to continue
this tradition. The remnant, however—the
Gallicans, as they called themselves—preferred even
an Italian to a Limousin; and their spokesman,
Robert of Geneva, made overtures to the Trans-Alpines.
The result was the election of a man of no party, a
man who was not even a Cardinal. Bartolommeo
Prignano, Archbishop of Bari, was an Italian; but he
was something more than an Italian; he was a
Neapolitan, a subject of Queen Giovanna, and therefore
presumably in favour of the French. He had
lived at Avignon, and was familiar with French
customs and French policy. It was hoped that he
might prove a bond of union. Scarcely was his
election accomplished, in haste, amid the noises of
the shouting mob outside, when the impatient Romans
burst into the Conclave, clamouring for a Roman
Pope. The Cardinals dared not confess their choice
of a Neapolitan, and in their terror they lied, imposing
on the people the Cardinal of St. Peter’s, a Roman
born. This fraud, together with the constraint put
on the Conclave by the violence of the mob, were a
few months later alleged against the validity of the
election of Prignano.</p>

<p class='c006'>But at first no conscience was troubled by this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>irregularity. For six months the Archbishop of Bari
wore an undisputed tiara, and Urban VI. succeeded
quietly to Gregory. Urban was zealous for reform,
passionately determined against simony, pure in his
life, energetic, resolute; but virtue has seldom been
manifest in so unlovable an Avatar. The man was a
Neapolitan peasant: short, squat, coarse, and savage.
He flung rude words and violent speeches like mud
in the faces of his elegant French Cardinals. “Fool!”
“Blockhead!” “Simoniacal Pharisee!”—such were
the hard nails with which he studded the ever unpalatable
word Reform; and one day, had not Robert
of Geneva caught the holy father by the sleeve, he
would have struck a Cardinal in the assembled
Consistory.</p>

<p class='c006'>Robert of Geneva was thirty-six years old; he was
tall, commanding, with a handsome face and fine
manners. His aristocratic urbanity veiled a nature
that did not scorn to do and dare. There could be
no greater contrast to the Pope than he, and he became
the idol of the Cardinals, although, in fact, he, the
Arch-Gallican, was the distant cause of the election
of Urban. His reputation for ferocity in battle
added a prestige to his pleasant courtliness: it was
he who should have been the Pope! He would not
have kept the College, throughout the sweltering
summer, in Rome where the detested Urban declared
that he would live and die. Something must
be done, and at once, for Urban threatened to create
a majority of Italian Cardinals. One by one the
Cardinals left Rome for their health. Their resort
was first Anagni, thence they went to Fondi. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>an open secret in Rome wherefore they found the air so
good there. Urban got wind of their conferences, and
on the 18th of September he created twenty-eight
Italian cardinals. Two days later there was a great
ceremony in the church at Fondi. The French Cardinals
announced to the world that at last a legitimate
Pope had been elected in succession to Gregory.
He was, of course, a Frenchman; he was Robert of
Geneva; he was Clement VII., the first Antipope of
the great Schism.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Church was terribly divided by this news—Clement,
elected by all the French, was not repudiated
by the Italian Cardinals, who, playing
the waiting game of their nation, remained neutral.
Yet the contest was a contest not of persons, but of
nationalities. “The significance of Urban’s election
lay in the fact that it restored the Papacy to
Rome, and freed it from the influence of France.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
Catharine of Siena clearly perceived this significance,
and wrote of Clement, who was to undo her sacred
mission, as “a devil in the shape of man.” In
the North of Italy the campaign of Clement in
the previous year persuaded the decimated cities
of the truth of this opinion; but the South was
not firm for Urban, and Naples openly declared
herself the champion of his rival. The confusion
was not only in Italy. The Church everywhere
was shaken to its foundations. In many bishoprics
there were two bishops;<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a> there was a terrible doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>in the minds of the Faithful, for of the two Popes,
one must be Antichrist, his followers heretics, and
consigned to eternal damnation. It is not too much
to say that the authority of the Church never recovered
from this long and terrible questioning. The
minds of the pious turned from the Church to God;
Mysticism and heresy consoled the uncertain; and
false prophets were common in the land.</p>

<p class='c006'>Confusion in the Church was echoed by confusion
in the State. England, because of the war with
France, was passionate for Urban. The Empire also
was for Urban; and Brittany, and all whose hand
was against the French. “France desires not
merely the Papacy, but the universal monarchy of
the globe,” wrote Urban to the Emperor.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a> But
among the smaller states France had still her supporters;
Scotland, Savoy, Naples, Leon, and Castile
followed in her wake, and declared for Clement.
There was great joy in France. Louis of Anjou,
perhaps the first of European princes to send in his
adhesion to the Antipope, was consoled for the
departure of Gregory; and when the news was
brought to the king, he exclaimed, “I am Pope at
last!” But the joy was the joy of princes, not the joy
of the people. The nation mourned the confusion that
had fallen on the Church, and the University of
Paris wrapped itself in a melancholy neutrality.</p>

  <h2 id='chap5' class='c004'><span class='sc'>Valentine Visconti.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c015'>I.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Valentine Visconti, greater than Helen as the cause
of battles, was born in the Abbey of Pavia, in the
year 1366. Her grandfather, Galeazzo Visconti, had
left Milan rather suddenly, being ill with gout and
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“temendo la severità”</span> of one so skilled in the use
of succession-powders as Bernabò his brother, co-tyrant
with him of Lombardy. He had designed
a safe and splendid castle for himself in Pavia.
While it was still unfinished Valentine was born in
the hospitable old Certosa there.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Galeazzo Visconti had taken with him from Milan
his wife, Blanche of Savoy, his little daughter Iolanthe,
and his married son Giangaleazzo, with his wife
Isabelle. These last were the parents of Valentine.
When she was born her mother was sixteen and her
father fifteen years of age.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a> At her nativity there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>were, we are told, incredible rejoicings; for the pride
of Galeazzo Visconti was gratified by the birth of a
grandchild who was no less the grand-daughter of a
King of France.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mother of Valentine was that little French
princess who, six years ago, had been sold into
Lombardy to help to raise the golden millions of her
father’s ransom. John the Good had received for his
daughter the sum of five hundred thousand golden
florins, a sort of inverse marriage portion, the price
of a royal alliance. But Galeazzo had not paid for
barren honour only: Isabelle had brought her husband
the county and the title of Vertus in Champagne.
Though the little girl had gone weeping into Italy,
her tears were soon dried. She had left a devastated
and ruined country; she came into a land of
sumptuous tyranny, of riches and magnificence.
Life was easy at Milan and at Pavia, where Galeazzo
was busied with his new university, where Giangaleazzo—a
timid, intellectual, orderly creature—spent
day after day in his study full of enormous parchment
ledgers, directing the staff of secretaries who
copied into them his accounts, his memoranda, and
duplicates of his correspondence. Priests and friars
from the old Certosa, professors of law and learning
from the new college, poets also—the English poet,
Master Geoffrey Chaucer, and the prince of poets himself,
Messer Francesco Petrarca,—learned men like
Philippe de Mézières, visitors from so far away as
England, France, or Cyprus—these were the guests of
the palace. Gradually the stately home echoed with
children’s voices. Valentine was born in 1366. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>brother grew strong and playful at her side; another
died in babyhood. When the third was born, in
1373, Isabelle died, and a few months afterwards her
baby followed her.</p>

<p class='c006'>The immense castle of Pavia was very quiet now.
Iolanthe, the girl-widow of the Duke of Clarence, had
married, in 1372, the Marquis of Monferrat. There
were only the old Visconti and his wife, and the studious
young Count of Vertus and his two little children.
It was quieter still when, in 1378, Galeazzo
Visconti died. He had been a terrible old man:
cruel, unscrupulous, scholarly. It was he who
obtained from the Emperor, Charles IV., in 1361,
the privilege to found the University of Pavia, and
he who protected it by an edict threatening with
heavy punishments the Milanese who dared to study
in another school. And he it was, also, who threw
alive into a fiery furnace two priests who came to him
on an unwelcome message; and he who, with his
brother Bernabò, had poisoned a third brother, co-heir
and co-tyrant with them in Lombardy. They had
divided his share, Galeazzo taking Piacenza, Pavia,
the west to Novara, and as far as Como in the north;
while Bernabò possessed the rich province of the
east. Both ruled alike in Milan. Both should have
been equally powerful. But Galeazzo had left all his
share to the sole Count of Vertus, and he, too, had
only one son to follow him, whereas the signory of
Bernabò was strengthened and divided by eleven
turbulent and violent young sons.</p>

<p class='c006'>Valentine’s father remembered the fate of his
uncle. He kept very quiet, surrounded himself with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>priests and guards, ate of no dish before a score of
stewards tasted of it, and dissimulated his ambition.
This he did so well that the timid Count of Vertus
became a by-word and a laughing-stock in the house
of Bernabò. Although the young man had taken
care to obtain from the Emperor investitures which
conferred upon him <em>absolute</em> authority;<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a> although
by his judicious protection of the people he made
himself the desired deliverer of the unhappy Milanese,
still Bernabò and his children could not take their
kinsman seriously. And the better to lull their
suspicions, in 1380 the young Count of Vertus came
a-courting to the noisy Castello di Porta Giovio,
where Bernabò kept house with such of his nine-and-twenty
children as still remained in Milan. It was
a great riotous house full of voices, full of splendid
young men in armour (Palamedes, Lancilotto, Sagramoro),
full of beautiful women and fair young girls
with lovely names (Achiletta, Verde, Damigella), and
not less radiant for their easy familiarity with evil.
One of these dangerous maidens, Caterina, the Count
of Vertus took to be his second wife. In the next
year, in 1381, on the 4th of October, his boy,
Astorre, died.</p>

<p class='c006'>Valentine was now his only heir, for during the
first eight years of their marriage Caterina Visconti
had no children. Valentine was fifteen years old, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>an age to be dowered and married. Her father,
however, kept her at home with him, teaching her
many things—too much, some people said, for they
thought her as wise as Medea. She could invent
posies; she could read not only Italian books, but
Latin, French, and German. Into whatever court
she might hereafter marry, she would be not only the
daughter of the Duke of Milan, but his diplomatic
agent. I do not know if she could speak English,
but in those years of warfare the English were often
at Milan, and Valentine when a little girl had seen
(a brilliant, sudden vision) her English uncle of
Clarence, who had died so strangely at Alba, and was
buried at Pavia. She was a scholarly maiden, possessing
of her own no less than eleven books; more than
her grandfather, King John, had ever owned in his
royal library at Paris. And she could write as well
as read—a clear, excellent hand, of which the signature
still exists in the Paris archives. Froissart in
later days remarked on the frequent letters that she
wrote to her father: “Madame Valentine wrote him
all she knew.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not know if Valentine was beautiful. A line
in “Le Pastouralet” speaks of her as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Maret, qui le miex dasoit,”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>and mentions the courtesy of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“la touse mignotte”</span>—the
dainty dame. This conveys an impression of
nothing more positive than elegance and grace. We
can fill up the frame with a couple of portraits which
still exists in the Bibliothèque Nationale: small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>grisaille illuminations adorning a manuscript poem<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
in defence of Valentine. There is nothing very distinctive
in either portrait—no accent of striking personality
or resemblance. They represent the same
young and slender woman, rather tall, with a long
neck and slim arms, and a bust both full and delicate.
The head is small, the hair parted from ear to ear
across the middle of the head, the back locks being tied
in a Greek knot, the front ones divided again in the
middle and looped in pendant braids above the ear.
Under this severe coiffure we discern a serious gentle
placid face—long narrow eyes, a high forehead, a
full mouth with pretty pursed lips; a face too closely
following the mediæval ideal for it to impress us
very strongly as a likeness. Valentine is clothed in
a low-cut, tight gown girdled round the hips, with
long, tight sleeves descending to the knuckles of the
slim and delicate hands—over this she wears a very
ample trained surtout, also low in the neck, falling
in rich folds to her feet and buttoned down the front
to the hips, where it is sewn together, but split up at
the arms in immense wide sleeve-holes, a yard long,
revealing the under dress. If the young duchess
was not precisely beautiful, yet certainly she was
beautifully attired. The catalogue of her gala-dresses
is a thing to wonder on: scarlet, and silver,
and cloth of gold, and rich embroidery; cloths of
peacock-green and mulberry colour; tissues of netted
pearls. And she had as many pearls, diamonds,
sapphires, and balass-rubies as any princess in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>fairy-story. She wore them sewn all over her caps,
round her girdles, encircling her young throat, and
showered broadcast across the brocades and embroidery
of her gowns. With all this, at sixteen,
and with the subtle sweetness of the natural Lombard
grace, it is not necessary to be beautiful.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>II.</h3>

<p class='c016'>In 1382 certain guests came to Milan, who marvelled
at the magnificence of these Viscontis, who talked
much with Valentine’s father, and who spread abroad
the tale of his daughter’s wisdom and her splendour.
They must also have impressed on the mind of this
young girl the strength, the beauty, and the wealth of
France. And they must no less have spurred the
silent and vigilant ambition of her father; for in the
late May of 1382, along the roads of Lombardy,
four thousand men rode together to be the guests of
Milan. They were all mounted on beautiful chargers
caparisoned in silk and precious metals; they were
all clad in suits of burnished armour; light aigrettes
floated from their helmets. “They seemed the
army of Xerxes,” wrote the Monk of St. Denis;
“their beasts of burden went slowly under loads of
gold and treasure. Those that beheld them, astrologers
and prophets, read in the future the records of
their fabulous glory.” In truth, they were a host of
heroes. Knights like the Count of Savoy and the
Count of Polenza went in the ranks. At their head
rode a tall, square-shouldered man, with fair locks
beginning to grizzle, and a handsome countenance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>He was magnificent in his cloak of woven gold and
lilies. This was Louis of Anjou, King of Sicily,
setting out for Naples to conquer his new kingdom.</p>

<p class='c006'>A kingdom in Italy! It was the dearest vision of
the age. The kingdom of Adria, a dream never
realized; the kingdom of Naples, a phantom eluding
for two hundred years the eager grasp of France.
In the subtle mind of Giangaleazzo Visconti, a third,
a vaster kingdom, was already taking shape—a kingdom
dead and buried for near five hundred years—the
kingdom of Italy!</p>

<p class='c006'>But to gain Italy it was necessary to be secure in
Milan. While his guests rode on triumphantly to
famine and disaster, the Count of Vertus elaborated
his plan. When the King of Sicily, wrapped in a
remnant of homespun daubed with painted yellow
lilies, lay dead in his unconquered kingdom, defeated
in his grave at Bari, Giangaleazzo Visconti ruled
supreme in Lombardy.</p>

<p class='c006'>He had plotted so well that one sole death secured
this change. On the 6th of May, 1385, Giangaleazzo,
apparently <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en route</em></span> for the shrine of our Lady of
Varese, passed by the gates of Milan. His uncle
and his cousins went out to meet him, smiling at
the immense guard which ever attended the timid
Hermit of Pavia. But now Giangaleazzo dropped
the mask. In an hour Milan was his, his cousins
his prisoners, and his uncle, with his <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>dilettissima
amante</em></span>, fast in the Castle of Trezzo. Giangaleazzo,
no less skilled in poisons than his father, had
him poisoned there, and buried him in Milan in a
sepulchre of splendid marble. But he showed no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>wanton cruelty. His cousins escaped, destitute indeed,
but unharmed. No unnecessary pain attended
the murder of the tyrant Bernabò, decently executed
by a well-cooked dish of vegetables. Ambition, not
revenge, nor the blood-mania of his race, was the
master passion of the new Lord of Lombardy. If
any questioned his proceedings, he could produce the
investiture of Wenzel, granting him absolute authority
and final judgment. The children of Bernabò were
stupefied and did not rebel; most of the sons went
to fight in the ranks of Sir John Hawkwood; and the
people of Milan hailed the Count of Vertus as a
deliverer. He taxed them heavily, indeed, but without
disorder; and his police were so excellent that he used
to smile and say, “I am the only robber in my
provinces.” Giangaleazzo was now master of a great
domain, immensely rich, three-and-thirty. He meant
to go far. In 1386 he sent to Pope Urban, demanding
the title of <em>King of Italy</em>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Urban refused, and in future the Ghibelline Count
of Vertus addressed his requests to the Emperor, or
else to the Anti-Pope at Avignon, who asked nothing
better than to make himself a party in Italy. But
first of all, Giangaleazzo began to conquer his
kingdom. Verona, Padua, Pisa, Siena, Perugia,
Assisi, Bologna, Spoleto, fell like ninepins before his
gathering force. Florence began to tremble. Foreign
countries began to talk of this new conqueror, of his
force, his wealth, his one young daughter. Clement
the Pope of Avignon, among others, perceived that
with Anjou in the south and Visconti in the north,
a great Gallic party might be formed in Italy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Clement was at once the creature and the patron of
the kings of France. In the winter of 1386-87,
while the Milanese messenger still were in the saddle
arranging a marriage between Valentine and the
Emperor’s brother, suddenly the Governor of Vertus
arrived at Pavia. He brought a message from the
King of France, the young Charles VI. The King
demanded the hand of Valentine for his only brother,
Louis.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was an important step. The two first children
of the King of France had died as soon as they
were born, and Louis was still the heir to the Crown.
Valentine, six years after her father’s second marriage,
was still his only child. It was current in France
that the Count of Vertus turned to his daughter and
said, “When I see you again, fair daughter, I trust
you will be Queen of France.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>III.</h3>

<p class='c016'>This proposal, which came as a surprise to Europe
and almost as an outrage to the Emperor, was no
surprise to the Lord of Milan. Months before
Giangaleazzo had laid his plans. There exists at
Paris in the Archives Nationales (K. 554, No. 7) the
summary of a Project of Marriage between Louis and
Valentine, dated the 26th of August, 1386.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is interesting to note that in this early draft
there is no thought of any possible French claim to
Milan. Valentine is dowered with Asti and its revenue—for
which her husband was never to be constrained
to pay homage; she was also to bring her husband
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>450,000 golden florins, and to come to him <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“bien
joyellée et aornée de joyaulx.”</span> And, only after the
death of her father, she was to succeed to the county
of Vertus in Champagne.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was a great deal, but this was not enough.
There was in France a strong party so hostile to the
Lord of Milan, that riches, and mere riches, were
not enough to overpower their opposition. Visconti
desired above all things a Royal alliance. He saw
that the Guelf—the national party—in Italy was
strong and was unrepresented. He would be Head of
the Guelfs, until he secured something better, and
his best title to that Headship was a French alliance.
Moreover, self-preservation, no less than ambition,
rendered the marriage desirable. Isabel of Bavaria,
granddaughter of the murdered Bernabò Visconti,
was Queen of France. How could Giangaleazzo
suffer that his exiled cousins should possess so
tremendous an advantage over him? He may have
felt himself insecure in his usurped sovereignty, so
long as France was united by blood and interest
only to the Disinherited. If Valentine married Louis,
Milan was safe from France. So at Christmas, 1386,
Giangaleazzo offered the husband of Valentine the
county of Vertus, in his lifetime as well as after his
death, and included in the marriage contract the
astounding clause of the succession of Valentine to
Milan.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even without this, Valentine was a very wealthy
heiress; she brought back to France her mother’s
dowry, the county of Vertus in Champagne. In
addition to this she took into the kingdom 450,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>golden florins, a freight of golden ornaments and
jewels, furniture to the amount of 70,000 florins, gold
and silver plate, and the county of Asti in Lombardy,
with a yearly income of nearly 30,000 golden florins.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The county of Asti comprised a whole province
of towns, villages, and castles. Thirty signories
were in its fief; forty-eight villas paid homage to
the Count of Asti; Brie and Cherasco, two large
towns in Piedmont, belonged directly to him. In the
politics of those times few things are more striking
than the singular lightmindedness with which a king
of France bestows upon a Lombard adventurer a
county in the very heart and centre of his own
kingdom; or the confidence with which an Italian
conqueror hands the key of his position to a wealthy
neighbour. The situation of the French at Asti
turned out to have the very gravest political consequences.
It assured them Savona, Genoa, Pisa for a
moment, and a century of wars about the Milanese.
For this secure footing in Lombardy gave a point of
reality to their vision of an Italian kingdom, and
made the subtraction of Italy from the Empire appear
not only desirable but possible. On the other hand,
it familiarized Italy with the French. Henceforth the
Italian princes, in any dispute among themselves,
would call in the protection not only of the King of
France but of their French neighbour, the powerful
Count of Asti.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>But at first the Lombards did not like it. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“I
Lombardi,”</span> says Corio, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“furono di mala voglia.”</span>
What they really dreaded was the succession of
Valentine and her French husband to Milan. This
is too complicated and intricate a question to dispose
of here. I will only say that the Italians believed
that in some fashion Giangaleazzo had secured Milan
to his daughter, in case he should have no sons,
or (as actually happened) in case all his sons should
die childless. But the question of the French claim
to Milan deserves a history to itself.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c016'>In April, 1387, Valentine of Milan was married
by proxy and parole to Louis, Duke of Touraine.
The bride was twenty-one, the bridegroom just sixteen;
but, as Juvenal des Ursins remarked, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Assez
caut, subtil et sage de son aage.”</span> But not until the
3rd of June, 1389, did the Lord of Milan send his
married daughter to her home in France.</p>

<p class='c006'>For in France a powerful faction opposed the
marriage. The king was little more than a lad;
entirely—or, of late, <em>almost</em> entirely—submissive to
his uncle, the Duke of Burgundy. When the wise
King Charles expired in the autumn of 1380, he
left the custody of his two children to this younger
brother of his, who in all his battles and adventures
had been his right-hand man. But the King left the
Regency of the Kingdom to the elder of his brothers,
the Duke of Anjou. In every sense the brothers were
rivals and antagonists; the interests of Anjou lay to
the South, the interests of Burgundy to the North.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Anjou was a man of culture, made by nature to
be the head of a society of nobles; while Burgundy,
the Captain, was the champion of popular rights.
In nothing were they at one. When Anjou left the
kingdom to conquer Naples, and when the news came
to France that he would nevermore return, the supremacy
of Burgundy appeared secure. But Anjou had
left behind him a successor—not his son, the child-king
of Sicily. No, the real successor to his aims
and policy was his nephew, the Prince Louis, the
younger of the two sons of the dead king.</p>

<p class='c006'>Little harmony between this lad and his uncle of
Burgundy! At ten years old the child fights like a
hero at Rosebecque; but the old captain, his tutor,
keeps all his smiles for the other nephew, the
docile and amiable king. He feels in Louis a spirit
of danger, a breath of insubordination. And, in
truth, one after the other, the ancient counsellors
and servitors of Anjou take shelter in the household
of the prince. Burgundy feels that Louis is Anjou
Redivivus—he must be kept low. And for this the
testament of Charles V. gives ample warrant: for
that king, well-named the Wise, feeling that the
danger of France lay in the greatness of her princes,
had conquered his fatherly heart and decreed that his
younger son should have no more than a pension
of 12,000 livres a year. But this was not to be. As
time went on, and the Regency came to an end, Louis
stimulated his placid brother to a sense of independence.
And the young king, less Roman than
his father, and glad perhaps to feel in the kingdom
another power than that of Burgundy, began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>enrich his only brother, giving him the counties of
Valois and Beaumont, lands in Cotentin, Caen, Champagne,
and Brie: then the Duchy of Touraine; the promise
of the inheritance of the old Duchess of Orleans;
finally, this rich marriage with Valentine Visconti.</p>

<p class='c006'>Burgundy resisted with might and main. Not only
would this marriage make Louis too strong, but of
all brides Valentine was the bride least to his mind.
For Burgundy had married two of his own children
into the House of Bavaria, and had given a Bavarian
princess—the vivacious Isabel—as wife to the
young king. Now all these Bavarians were the
grandchildren of Bernabò, murdered by the father
of Valentine. Also the niece of Burgundy, Béatrix
d’Armagnac, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“la gaie Armagnageoise,”</span> had married
in 1382. This Carlo Visconti, Lord of Parma, heir
of Bernabò, had been stripped of all his goods by
Giangaleazzo and Beatrice, no longer laughing, had
returned to eat the bread of exile in her brother’s
house. Thus the Queen, and Burgundy, and Armagnac,
and Berry (the other brother of the dead
king) were bound by every instinct of natural anger
and honourable vendetta to look upon Giangaleazzo
as the spoiler of their kinsmen—of mother, children,
niece, or husband—and in their eyes the riches of
Milan were the price of blood. Not one of these
but hoped to oust the usurper and restore the rightful
line. And so for two years they contrived to defer
the marriage.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Meanwhile the influence of Burgundy weakened,
that of Prince Louis increased, with the king. In
the autumn of 1388 the disastrous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Voyage d’Allemagne”</span>
deeply discredited Burgundy, its author. In
their tent at Corenzich, far from Queen and Court,
the two brothers held long colloquies. Not in vain
did Louis plead for his bride. In the summer of
1389, Philippe de Florigny was sent into Lombardy
to bring her home.</p>

<p class='c006'>Valentine took away with her an escort of knights,
a burden of gold and gems, the possession of Asti,
and the promise of Milan. She had in her caskets
three hundred thousand pearls of price, beside the
pearls upon her gala-dresses. Her plate was valued
at more than one hundred thousand marks Parisis.
Her jewels, ornaments, and tapestries were estimated
at nearly seven hundred thousand golden florins.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
Giangaleazzo had found nothing too costly or too
radiant for his only daughter. When at last he let
her go, he rode with her out of the gates of Pavia,
saying never a word of farewell, looking not once
into her beloved face, lest he should fall a-weeping.
In the saddest hour of her tragic life, Valentine
remembered with tears that silent parting.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was the 17th of August, 1389, according to the
dates of the Monk of St. Denis, when Valentine rode
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>into Melun to meet her bridegroom. The King was
there as well as all the Court—a Court full of kinsmen
for Valentine. The Viscontis counted their alliances
with the kings of France back into those mythical
ages when Æneas, ancestor of either House, founded
the city of Angleria. Valentine found plenty of more
recent connections. The King and her husband
were both her first cousins, and so was the young
King of Sicily; the Dukes of Burgundy and Berry
were her uncles. She was also, as I have said, first
cousin once removed to the King’s young wife, Isabel
of Bavaria. She was cousin also to Madame de
Montauban, cousin by marriage to Madame d’Armagnac.
But these three kinswomen looked on her with
horror, and all her splendour seemed to them unholy
spoil fresh from the unclean hands of her father, the
triumphant assassin of his kinsmen.</p>

<p class='c006'>The jealousy and suspicion of the Queen must have
been the earliest greeting of Valentine at Melun.
Queen Isabel was the idol of the Court. Radiantly
beautiful, eighteen years old, she was not satisfied
with the devotion of her husband. Charles VI. was
a gentle, kind-hearted, stalwart young man, at two-and-twenty
already rather bald, clear of eye and
cheek, generous, slow-witted, unapt to State and
dignity. He was lovable and sweet in temper; “he
emitted, like an odoriferous flower, the ingenuity of
his perfect character,” writes the anonymous Monk
of St. Denis. But at his side, more brilliant and more
eloquent than he, rode the first knight of chivalry,
the King’s only brother, Louis, Duke of Touraine.
This young man was eighteen years old, extremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>handsome, so witty and so wise that in the University
of Paris there were no doctors who were proof against
his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>bonne memoire et belle loquelle</em></span>. Often at night, in
the Hôtel de Saint Paul at Paris, he and the young
Marshal Boucicault would sit into the grey hours of the
morning, devising and arguing the nature of the soul,
or making rondels, songs, and ballads. Other days
and nights were spent in less innocent amusements;
for the beautiful Duke of Touraine was so irresistible
a lover that popular fancy endowed him with a
magic wand and an enchanted ring, making him
absolute master of all women. None the less—though
in a knight it were more noble to succour
than to enslave fair ladies—the Duke was considered
(a woman has pronounced it) “the very refuge and
retreat of chivalry.” And the charm of his youth
and beauty, of his rhetoric and laughter, of his gentle
manners and brilliant knightliness, still exhales from
the dusty pages of Christine de Pisan and Juvenal
des Ursins. These two loved him. But the hostile
Monstrelet, the critical Monk of St. Denis, the unenthusiastic
Froissart—even these assure us of his
enchanting presence.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to Burcarius the King was handsomer
than his young brother; but we must allow for a
natural Burgundian hostility to Louis, and a
natural Burgundian preference for force and valour,
fresh colour, sweet temper, good humour, and all
vigorous northern qualities, in preference to the subtler
charms of their enemy. The stalwart Fleming thinks
the King the finest man at Court, and handsomer than
any there, far handsomer than his wife, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“jolie et
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>avenante,”</span> indeed, but <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“basse et brunette”</span>: fatal
defects in the eyes of a Fleming! Her indisputable
empire over men he ascribes not to her face, but to
her lively manners. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Folle et légère,”</span> was she:</p>

<p class='c006'>As for Louis, the Burgundian has no word in
favour of this melancholy free-lover, this <em>Tristifer</em>
(for such is the name he goes by among shepherds)
who sins with no pleasure in sin; who spends his
days in the pursuit of love, yet keeps a heart of
iron; whose joys are such as are not to be found
in the real world, but the fantastic joys of art,
repugnant to the Philistine:</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the Burgundian ... unaware that this portrait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of his enemy is the only one that awakens curiosity
and stimulates the fancy. And, by way of adding a
blacker touch than all, he tells us that this singing
Tristifer is the paramour of the gay Queen
Belligère.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have said that Louis was held to possess an unearthly
ring, a magic wand, of desire. For a perfect
knight it was said that he had put them to strange
uses. He had fascinated with his wand, he had bewitched
with the circle of his ring, the young wife of
his brother, the beautiful Queen Isabel. And he was
the bridegroom of Valentine Visconti. Queen Isabel
was at Melun to greet her new kinswoman. We can
imagine with what critical eyes she ran her over.
Valentine, though not beautiful, was a novel and
irradiating vision in her veil of gems. She was wise
too; she could talk with her husband over the poems
he made, the verses of Lord Salisbury and Maître
Eustache Deschamps, the romances of Wenzel of
Luxembourg, or of Maître Jean d’Arras, all the
literature of the Court. She could argue with him,
this subtle Lombard, in the tenuous and fanciful
dissertations that he loved. Queen Isabel could not
endure to see this stranger, by reason of her splendour
and her novelty become the centre of attraction.
The marriage festival was scarcely over when Isabel
persuaded her husband to ordain a greater festivity
for herself. She had been married four years, she
was known by sight to every clerk in the Rue St.
Denis, yet the King, obedient to her behest, proclaimed
the Royal Entry of the Queen into
Paris.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>V.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>This Paris that Valentine entered as a stranger
was a beautiful city. The streets and bridges had
been largely rebuilt by her uncle, Charles the Wise.
Between the new Bastille and the river he had raised
an immense royal palace, the Hôtel de St. Paul.
Close at hand stood the Palais de Tournelles, the great
hotel of the King of Sicily, the Hôtel Clisson, and the
Hôtel de Behaigne, where the husband of Valentine
sometimes lived. A little farther off (in the Rue de
Turbigo) the castle of the Duke of Burgundy still
rears its out-dated menace. On the left bank of the
Seine another group of palaces surrounded Nôtre
Dame. At the extremity of the city stood the Louvre.
Rebuilt by Charles the Wise, it was endowed by him
with a library of nine hundred and ten volumes
(chiefly illuminated missals, legends, miracles, and
treatises on astrology). There a silver lamp burned
always day and night in the service of students, to
whom the library was ever open.</p>

<p class='c006'>Paris was a beautiful city; but it seemed a paradise
upon the occasion of the royal entry. The Rue St.
Denis was draped from top to bottom in green and
crimson silk scattered with stars. Under the gateway
angels sang in a starry heaven, and to the sweet
sound of instruments little children played a miracle.
There were towers and stages raised along the streets,
where the legend of Troy-town and other pleasant
matters were enacted. There were fountains also, flowing
with milk or flowing with claret. Maidens, in rich
chaplets of flowers, stood beside them and out of golden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>cups they gave the passers-by to drink, and sang
melodiously the while; up and down this magic city
went the citizens’ wives and daughters in long robes
of gold and purple. The citizens themselves were
clad in green, the royal officers in rose colour. But
all these splendours paled and dwindled when the
royal procession came in sight. In the middle, in an
open litter, sat the Queen, the beautiful, smiling idol
of the feast; she was dressed in a gown of silk, sewn
over with French lilies worked in gold. Behind her,
in painted cars, went the great ladies of the Court.
Only the Duchess of Touraine had no litter; Valentine
rode on a fair palfrey, marvellously caparisoned; she
went on one side of the Queen’s litter among the royal
dukes. The people of Paris, says Froissart, were as
anxious to see the new Duchess as the Queen, whom
indeed they had often seen. For Madame Valentine
was immensely rich, the daughter of a great conqueror,
and she had only just come out of Lombardy,
a mysterious country where wonderful things came to
pass. What impression did Valentine make on the
people of Paris, pressing and craving to see the foreign
duchess?</p>

<p class='c006'>Which of her gala-dresses did she wear? The
scarlet one sewn thick with pearls and diamonds,
with a cap of pearls and scarlet for her dusky hair?
Or the robe of gold brocade with sleeves and headdress
of woven pearls? Or the flashing crown of
balasses and sapphires, and the dress of scarlet sewn
with jewels and embroidered with pale blue borage
flowers? In any of these this splendid Italian
stranger must have appeared to the burghers of Paris
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>as a vision of Southern luxury, of mysterious outlandish
enchantment. At least it is certain that
never after they looked upon her as a mere mortal
woman. Just at that season every one was reading
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Mélusine”</span> of Maître Jean d’Arras. Valentine of
Milan with her fairy splendours, her subtle wisdom,
her Lombard traditions—Valentine, with the Visconti
snake on her escutcheon—must have seemed to these
Parisians much such another mysterious serpent-woman,
another Mélusine. For the Italian character,
never fanatic and yet so prone to spiritual passions;
seldom bestial, yet so guilty of unnatural vices—Italy
has ever been a mystery, a hateful enigma to the
practical French; and of all Italians the Lombards,
the border people, are most unlike their Gallic
neighbours. A century later, when the French
poured into Italy, no blazing mountain of Vesuvius,
no wonderful Venetian city swimming in the seas, no
antique and glorious ruins of Rome, so much astonished
the foreign soldiers as the learned and subtle
ladies of Lombardy. Those later chroniclers who
have been in Italy relate with wonder their fables of
ecstatic virgins, and gifted women wiser than their
sex; they have seen one Anna, a woman forty years
of age, who never eats, drinks, or sleeps, and who
bears on her body the mystical wounds of Christ,
breaking out and bleeding afresh on every Friday.
In Milan, a demoiselle Trivulce, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“de son grant jeune
aage,“</span> wrote letters in Latin and was eloquent in
oratory; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“elle estoit aussi poeticque”</span> (adds the
author of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Mer des Chroniques</span>) <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“et scavoit moult
bien disputer avecques clercs et docteurs.”</span> And also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>she was virtuous, so that her holy life seemed a thing
to marvel on. At Venice, Maître Nicole Gilles encountered
a certain Virgin Cassandra, the daughter
of Angelo Fideli, a maiden expert in the seven liberal
arts and in theology, all of which matters she expounded
in public lectures. At Quiers, near Asti, a
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“jeune pucelle,”</span> the daughter of Maître Jehan Solier,
received the king with a public and most eloquent
oration. Learned and subtle and virtuous as these
Lombard ladies were, enthusiastic and spiritual as
were many of their countrymen, yet this strange
Italy, where the women taught the men, where Jesus
Christ in Florence was the official head of the Republic,
inspired a secret dread and horror in the French.
Like men in an enchanted country, they feared what
might lurk behind the shows of things. Above all,
the French could never rid themselves of a haunting
suspicion of poison—poison and sorcery, underhand
and terrible weapons, such as these frank and passionate
Gauls associated with the subtlety and
wisdom of the people they had conquered. “And
yet,” says Commines, “I must here speak somewhat
in honour of the Italian nation, because we never
found in all this voyage that they <em>did</em> seek to do us
harm by poison, and yet, if they had chosen, we could
hardly have avoided it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This attitude of suspicion towards Italy, of reluctant
admiration, characterized the French of 1494. Minus
the admiration, it is quite as significant of the French
to-day; and in 1387 the same distrust was there, but
sharper, more anxious, and the same wonder, but
intensified. Valentine the Italian, seemed to these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>alert, honest, practical Parisians a marvel of strangeness
and wisdom; but to them these attributes suggested
chiefly a fatal potency for evil.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, in truth, there was in Italy a wickedness such
as for another hundred years should not penetrate into
France. The Italians were a nation of secret poisoners;
and the French bourgeois vaguely guessed that this
splendid young lady was acquainted with a world
terribly different from their ingenuous and turbulent
Paris. No need for turbulence in Italy. Valentine’s
father poisoned the uncle who, for his part, had,
poisoned his own brother. And Giangaleazzo, who,
as Corio relates, had been nearly poisoned by Antonio
della Scala, disposed of that enemy by the self-same
means. The Florentines<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a> (but theirs is the evidence
of an enemy) said he paid his official poisoner a
hundred florins monthly. These it was murmured
were the traditions of the new Duchess.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, after all, Queen Isabel played but the
second part in the pageant of her entry. Soon,
however, she forgot her jealousy of the Italian—a
jealousy which on that holiday kept her sick in her
chamber, while Valentine danced with Touraine and
the King in the royal ball below. But Valentine was
no rival of the beautiful, bright little Queen: she was
a persistent, ambitious, and devoted woman, never
vain and never timid. From the first she lavished on
her boyish husband that passionate devotion of an elder
woman which asks no return from the radiant young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>creature she adores. She did not grudge Louis the
love of Isabel, if, indeed, that love was his. A stranger
thing happened: Valentine united with her rival to
push the fortunes of Touraine. These two women
were ever together, ever scheming, and planning the
welfare of the unfaithful husband of the one, whom
an unbroken tradition has regarded as the criminal
lover of the other. An unnatural league; but it
served to strengthen Touraine.</p>

<p class='c006'>For Valentine and Isabel alike had the ear of the
King. Charles VI., a little slow, a little dull, neglected
in his Court, betrayed by his wife for his more
brilliant brother—this gentle, kindly, unimportant
creature was irresistibly drawn to his sister-in-law.
Of all her royal kinsfolk in France, the King was the
only one who from the first had welcomed Valentine.
“My dear sister, my beloved sister,” the words were
ever on his lips. Valentine, like him, was set aside;
like him she suffered. She, too, was patient and
gentle; but she was strong, she was prudent. The
King of France was a great heavy lad, over-boyish for
his years, loving jests and disguises, hating ceremony,
and only very dimly feeling the wrongs that perplexed
him; he sought from the sweet and quiet Italian her
protection no less than her compassion.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1390, at Montpellier, the King could not support
his absence from her. “I am too far from the Queen
and Madame Valentine,” he said to his brother.
“Let us ride post haste to Paris.” Unaccompanied
and for a wager, they rode all the way, four nights
and nearly five days in the saddle....  A little later
the physicians said that such violent exercises as this
had unsettled the feeble reason of the King.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>VI.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In 1391, the young Duke of Touraine acquired the
succession of the Duchess of Orleans. He was now
as rich as he was ambitious. Could the old king, his
father, have seen his eminence and his ambition, he
would have risen from his grave, and have returned to
the salvation of France. But the dust was in his
ears and eyes, and it was not to be so.</p>

<p class='c006'>For some time the King had been ailing with a
hot fever. He was, says the Monk of St. Denis,
strange, languishing, and bewildered. When, in the
summer of 1392, the French invaded Brittany, the
Dukes, his uncles, conjured him to remain at home.
But Charles was not to be persuaded. He started
with them upon the long, fatiguing journey.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 5th of August, near the town of Mans, after
some hours of riding in armour under a beating sun,
the royal party passed the Lepers’-village. A beggar,
a leper, dressed in rags, the outcast of the world, the
lowest human thing, came out and accosted the young
King of France: “Go no farther, noble King, they
betray you!” The King was startled, and though the
Royal Guards interfered they could not at once shake
off the loathsome prophet. Clinging to the King’s
bridle, the leper cried again, “Go no farther, noble
King, they betray you!”... They betray you!
Louis and Isabel, his nearest and dearest, what else
did they? The King said nothing.</p>

<p class='c006'>About an hour afterwards, suddenly, the King set
upon his brother, his spear a-tilt, as hunters hunt a
stag.... The more distant of the royal party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>thought the King had spied a hare or a hart in
the forest.... Then, as the truth dawned, there
was a dreadful scene. Cries, wounds, men falling
from their horses, and a fanatic madman who none
the less was still a sacred and irresistible presence!
The King of France was furiously and murderously
mad.</p>

<p class='c006'>Four men were slain, others saved themselves by
simulating death. Orleans fortunately was not hurt
at all. For four days the King’s frenzy lasted, with
fits of delirium and lapses into death-like exhaustion.
The most cruel part of his sickness was the evident
anguish of his spirit. “Will no one pluck out of my
heart the dagger that my fair brother of Orleans has
planted there?” the poor mad youth would cry; and
he would mutter to himself, “I must kill him! I
<em>must</em> kill him!” It was useless to instruct the people
that there is no reason in the sick hatred of a distempered
mind. Nor would they find sufficient
motive in the rumoured unfaithfulness of Isabel with
Louis. They sought a darker, a more subtle explanation,
and their suspicions were fostered, for political
ends, by the enemies of Orleans—the faction of his
uncle, the Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p class='c006'>For when the King recovered from his frenzy, his
mind remained weak and disabled. It was necessary
to hand over to his uncles for a while the direction of
affairs. This made the strongest of them, Philip,
Duke of Burgundy, more than ever strong; he was
in fact, though not in form, the regent. Against his
rule one voice was ever raised in protest, the voice of
the young ambitious brother of the King.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Louis of Orleans was now twenty-one years of age;
through his marriage and the gifts of the King he
had become formidably rich; through the weakness
of the King he was formidably powerful. He was the
nearest to the throne and he desired the regency.
But the people suspected Orleans; he had too much
to gain by the death or the incapacity of his brother.
The people, in their passionate pity for the gentle
monarch they adored, began to hate and fear the
Queen and Orleans. In later days they did not
scruple to declare their misgivings, but at first they
dared not directly accuse the Queen, they would not
directly accuse the young, beautiful Louis, their pride
from his childhood, eloquent, religious, gay, slow to
anger. With Juvenal they found him <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“beau prince
et gratieux;”</span> and, like Christine, they accounted
him, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“en ces jeunes faiz et en toutes choses très-avenant
... car il aime les bons ... nul fellonie
ni cruauté en luy.”</span> But he was young; he had been
led away (Juvenal finds the phrase for them) “<em>by the
means of those who were near to him</em>.... He had
strange youthful follies that I will not declare....
<em>There were those about him</em>, young people, who induced
him to do many things he had better have left undone.”
This vague and mysterious excuse is the veil
of a terrible accusation. The people began to say
that the Duke of Orleans was a sorcerer.</p>

<p class='c006'>The King mad; the King’s brother a wizard!
There was a contagion of horror in France. “Many
nobles and poor people,” writes the Monk of St.
Denis, “began to change and sicken with the same
strange malady that had attacked the King.” The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>fanatic terror of supernatural evil spread and
deepened.</p>

<p class='c006'>Things, at that critical season, fell out unfortunately
for Orleans. On the 29th of January, 1393,
there was a wedding festival at the Hôtel de St. Paul
for one of Queen Isabel’s German maids of honour.
The bride was a widow, and thrice a widow; therefore
a subject for the grotesque licence of the age.
At night, in the great hall among the dancers,
suddenly there burst in a company of six satyrs
dressed in tight linen vests, with flakes of tow
fastened with pitch upon their backs. These hideous
merry-makers sprang and danced about the bride,
with leaps and gestures, in a sort of diabolic frenzy.
Five of them were chained together, the sixth disported
loose. The sixth was the King. Stung by
some unlucky madcap prompting, Orleans took a
flaming torch from its bearer, and held it close to
the face of one of the maskers to see who he was.
A flake of fire from the torch dropped among the
tow and pitch. Up and down the hall, dancing a
wilder and more terrible saraband, the flaming satyrs
went. Two were burned to ashes, two died of their
burns in agony, one saved himself by leaping into
a water-butt. The King was rescued by the Duchess
of Berri, who wrapped him in her mantle. But the
danger and the fearful spectacle had upset his tottering
reason. The King was mad again.</p>

<p class='c006'>The people were furious against Orleans. Had
Charles been burned, his brother’s life must have
answered for it; for the people loved the King. The
party of Burgundy—the popular party—did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>hesitate to accuse the unfortunate young Duke of a
fiendish plot to murder his brother. It was in vain
that Louis raised a magnificent chapel of marble in
the Church of the Celestines, to expiate his involuntary
guilt. The people murmured that the Duke of
Orleans went too often to the Celestines. It was
said he went there every day. So much devotion
was uncanny in so wild a liver.</p>

<p class='c006'>Charitable souls like Demoiselle Christine declared
in vain—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“C’est impossible que son âme et ses mœurs
n’en vaillent mieux.”</span> Charitable souls are rare. The
mass of the people did not hesitate to say that Louis
visited the Celestines the better to conspire with a
certain monk there—an old counsellor of his father’s—one
Sire Philippe de Mézières. This person was
acknowledged to be wise, experienced, able, and a
man of science, according to the age. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Cestui vieil
solitaire”</span> for forty years had been the counsellor of
princes. For thirty years he had been the life and
soul of the policy of Cyprus, of Rhodes, of the
Christian East. Then disgraced by an ungrateful
king—Pierre II. de Lusignan—he took refuge in
France, bringing to the service of Charles V. his
enthusiasm, his political wisdom, his minute and
extensive acquaintance with the Courts of Italy and
the East. In 1379 he entered the Convent of the
Celestines in Paris; not too secluded to remain the
trusted counsellor of Charles V., and in his turn, of
his son Louis of Orleans. But though the good Sire
was a monk, the crowd doubted of his religion,
for it was common rumour that he said there was
no truth in sorcery. Let him say it! Sire Philippe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>de Mézières was none the less no judicious companion
for the Duke of Orleans. The Sire had lived too long
in Lombardy: “a country,” as Juvenal describes it,
“where they practice magic and the casting of
spells.”</p>

<p class='c006'>About the same time a malignant rumour grew in
France concerning the father of Valentine. People
said the Seigneur of Milan had asked the French
Ambassador for news of the King. “He is very
well,” replied the Frenchman. Whereupon Visconti
grew pale, and staggered. “He is the Devil!” he
said, with great admiration; or, according to another
version, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diabolicum recitas et quod est impossibile</span>—You
tell me a diabolic thing, and one that is
impossible! <em>The King can not be well!</em>“</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, it was generally known in Italy that the
Duke of Milan, like every other successful prince or
Signory, was a secret poisoner. But in France a
more terrible and a yet more hateful accusation was
rumoured against him. The people began to whisper
that the Duke of Milan was a wizard.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VII.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The King was mad again; he had fallen into the
first of innumerable relapses. Henceforth, for thirty
years, any moment of too poignant feeling would
throw him back in agony and madness. At such
times he suffered much. It would happen (says the
Monk of St. Denis), that as he sat in his council
chamber, receiving his ambassadors and discoursing
with sense and clearness, a sudden shudder would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>pass over him, the actual world would drift into
oblivion. Again the forest near Mans, the leper’s
warning, would rise on his tormented vision. He
would shriek out for help against his enemies, and
yet, poor king, be still aware these enemies were
phantasms. At such moments he would cry and wail
and sob, till all the Court fell a-weeping to hear him.
“O not madness. Death, any pain, anything but
madness!” and joining his hands he would look
eagerly in face after face of his kinsmen. “I pray
you, for the love of Christ, if any of you be party to
this magic, then let me die at once and end it.” But
no prayers avail, and as the fantastic world of lunacy
gradually eclipsed the receding truth, the King’s last
entreaty showed the unaltered sweetness of his tormented
nature. “Keep away all the knives,” he
would cry. “I had rather die than hurt any one.”
For no lapse of time, no suffering effaced in his
gentle character the stamp of that terrible moment
of Mans when he had awoken to find his innocent
hands stained henceforth for ever with innocent and
loyal blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>While the King wailed in desperate protest against
his oncoming madness, all the Court wept with him.
But, once that eclipse accomplished, the Court forgot
the King. Part of the royal palace of St. Paul’s had
been turned into a safe asylum. There the King
lived, sometimes for many weeks unwashed, eaten
with filth and vermin, suffering no attendant to approach
him. He was then a mere wild beast,
tormented with canine hunger, fierce, suspicious, and
sometimes wild with fear. Then he would pace from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>end to end of his apartments, fleeing his imaginary
pursuers, until he dropt exhausted in senseless
lethargy.</p>

<p class='c006'>But more often, and especially in the first years of
his illness, he was not sunk so low as this. He was
then an aimless, laughing, boyish imbecile. He was
no longer the King even in his own fancy; he had
forgotten himself as others had forgotten him. Did
he see his own arms or the Queen’s emblazoned anywhere
upon the walls, he would smear out that
heraldry, laughing the while and dancing in a
burlesque, unseemly fashion. “These are not my
arms. I am not King Charles. My name is George,”
he would cry, “and my arms are a lion pierced with
a spear.” The poor King was himself transfixed with
that intangible spear his fair brother of Orleans had
planted in his heart for ever. But in his madness,
his jealousy had undergone a subtle change. Sometimes
he could not endure the sight or mention of the
Queen and Orleans, but more often he utterly forgot
them. Once they brought Isabel into his presence.
He shook his head and swore he did not know the
lady.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was in all the world one only creature whose
presence shed a little balm and solace on his unhappy
lunacy. This was his sister-in-law, Madame Valentine.
She was the only person he ever fully recognized.
Absent and present he called upon her, “Oh,
my dearest sister! Oh, my beloved sister!” and if
Valentine left him a single day unvisited, the poor
king would wander up and down for hours in aimless
regret and complaining.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Valentine was kind and pitiful. Although at this
time she was ailing (her second son was born in
August, 1393), she did not fear to bring her delicate
magnificence into the filth and peril of the mad king’s
presence. For hours she would sit with him, playing
at cards: those painted Saracen Naibi which
Covelluzzo noticed at Viterbo (the first known in
Europe) in 1379. Perhaps Valentine had brought
them out of Italy; they were the only pastime of the
haggard king; and for hours the painted images of
Death, Love, Fortune, Madness, and the Angel, would
silently fall from the hands of these two unhappy
people, keeping each other melancholy company in
the dismantled chambers of the barred and altered
palace.</p>

<p class='c006'>Valentine was ill herself; she was a woman; and
yet she was not afraid of this tall, broad-shouldered
young man of twenty-five, subject to violent mania,
who in one fearful paroxysm had slain four men
in armour. His attendants dared not come too near.
But Valentine seemed to bear a charmed life, she did
not even tremble. This unnatural courage of hers,
this fascination, this mastery which she exercised
upon their king ... all this was terribly explicable
to the people of Paris.</p>

<p class='c006'>Who was this lady?—Valentine of Milan. “Now,”
says Juvenal, “her father was the Duke of Milan,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
who was a Lombard, and in his country they practise
magic and the casting of spells.” “The common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>people,” says the Monk, “declared the King was
bewitched. They accused the Duke of Milan, and
in confirmation of this ridiculous proposition they
said the Duchess of Orleans was the only person
the King recognized or cherished in his sickness.
They did not scruple to say she was a witch,
though that so generous a lady should commit so
great a crime is a fact that never has been proved.”
“The King’s physicians, arioles, and charmers,”
says Froissart, “affirmed the King was poisoned or
bewitched by craft of sorcery; they said they knew
it by the spirits that had showed it to them. Of
these diviners, arioles, and charmers, certain were
burned at Paris and at Avignon. They spake so
much, and said the Duchess Valentine of Orleans,
daughter to the Duke of Milan, had bewitched the
King.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In those days the accusation of sorcery was terrible
and ominous. To bewitch the King was the most
damnable of crimes, for witchcraft in itself was
treason against God. It was indeed no less than
taking out of heaven the tremendous issues of life and
death, apportioning them with profane and mortal
hands, and breaking the heavenly order of the
universe. God was mocked. This side of sorcery
excited the horror of theologians, but it was not this
that infuriated with helpless terror the shuddering
populace. We know how the Polynesian islanders
will die to-day of a fatal langour if they believe their
enemy has prayed against them. The citizens of
Paris in the Middle Ages died as easily. “Throughout
the kingdom,” says the Monk of St. Denis,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“many nobles and poor people are attacked with the
same strange malady as the King’s.” A contagion
of fear paralysed the sources of life. “For they can
bewitch you,” said, in 1407, Maître Jean Petit, a very
learned doctor in theology; “and they can bewitch
the King, and make him die in a very subtle manner,
quite unapparent, by the casting of a spell.” “A
word is enough,” said two Augustine friars who
suffered for sorcery in 1397, “a word, a touch; it is
no natural malady.” To those who suffered, and
saw their near and dear ones suffer of this incurable,
inexorable enchantment, there was no death too cruel
for the wizard.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Duke of Milan was a very powerful magician.
By spells and sorcery he, the weakest of his clan, had
made himself the most astute and potent of all the
princes of the West; by spells and sorcery he would
make his daughter queen of France. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Il n’y avait
qu’une bouche à clore,“</span> said Jean Petit. Valentine,
the people thought, was helping her father, for the
Duchess of Orleans was a witch.</p>

<p class='c006'>The powers of the Prince of the Air were in high
places. Valentine was not only protected by Satan—not
only served by Hermas and Astramin the two livid
demons of Montjoy that obeyed the House of Orleans—she
was also sheltered by the effulgence of the
throne. Every power, every protection was hers.
Hell and earth obeyed her, and heaven smiles upon
the sins of princes. Yet with the cruel heroism of
pity the people of Paris rose against her, pouring down
the streets, reaching out their fanatic hands to tear in
pieces no omnipotent demon in a violent aureole of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>flame, but a pale neglected foreign woman far from
home. They determined to save the King, and at
last the peril of the duchess grew so great that Marshal
Sancerre and many other nobles advised her
husband to send her out of Paris. So in great pomp,
nowise abashed, but with all the splendour of a royal
progress, Valentine left the city. She went to a
fair castle of her husband’s near Pontoise, and then
to Neufchatel upon the Loire. She went alone, for
Orleans was kept by State affairs in Paris. There
was a subtle political reason for the irritation of
France against the Milanese. In the complex
recesses of the human heart an actual terror of
supernatural evil, a crusader’s passion to avenge the
honour of God, may co-exist with the most sordid
calculations of a worldly advantage to be gained. It
was not only for the love of God that the Jews and
Moors of Spain, the Protestants of Flanders, the
monasteries of England, were made to enrich their
persecutors. It was not entirely for thirty pieces of
silver that Judas delivered a heretic to the secular
arm. And it was the easier to condemn the Duke of
Milan that he was not only a wizard, but the political
rival of France for the rich suzerainty of Genoa.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VIII.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The French had counted upon Giangaleazzo Visconti
rather as a captain than as a rival. Visconti had
looked upon the French as the tools of his ambition,
and not as serious competitors. In reality each was
in pursuit of the same thing; each desired to be
supreme in Italy.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Visconti had easily acquired the direction of his
son-in-law’s policy. It is not surprising. A lad of
eighteen, poor, kept under, systematically neglected,
Orleans before his marriage had known little of power,
nothing of supremacy. He was nominally Duke of
Touraine; but his estates were administered by the
King. Until a few months before his marriage he
had not even a house of his own, but lived with his
retinue in a corner of his brother’s palace. In
February, 1389, he appeared for the first time at the
Royal Council. Valentine brought him wealth, consideration,
and ambition; for, with the possession of
Asti, and under the guidance of his father-in-law, the
young Duke began to dream of battles and signiories
in Italy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Visconti was very willing to adopt his daughter’s
husband in place of the clever and valiant son he
should have had. His own son was a baby at the
breast. And Orleans brought him not only a clear
young mind, a fresh and eager will and the courage
that the great Visconti never had, but also the influence
of France. Thus the great Ghibelline saw within
his reach the support of the Guelfs. To reconcile all
parties for his own interest was ever the aim of this
unrivalled statesman, as magically gifted to make
peace as to foment a discord. Ghibelline and Guelf,
Emperor and King of France, Pope and Antipope,
aye, even Orleans and Burgundy, should join hands
to fight his battles.</p>

<p class='c006'>His first move was a whisper of ambition in the
ear of his son-in-law. And Louis forgot his love-making
and ballad-making, his jousting and feasting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and turned to other thoughts. Asti was his; Asti
should be the centre of his operations, and in swiftness
and silence a French army gathered in Asti.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1389, the very year of Orleans’ marriage, there
was peace with England; hence, leisure in Court and
camp; hence troops of riders and men-at-arms
infesting every countryside, preying on the ruined
peasants, and loitering hungry for another war.
Nothing easier than to enlist a company! In 1389
Orleans sent to his new county François, Seigneur de
Chassenage, as governor with twenty men-at-arms
and two chamberlains, each with twenty men-at-arms
and thirty archers. Fifty-five other men-at-arms and
as many archers were added to these, and formed the
nucleus of a rapidly increasing army. By the end of
June more men-at-arms and squires joined the service.
Enguerrand de Coucy, Lieutenant of the Duke and
Captain-General <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>ès parties d’Italie</em></span>, went to keep his
state at Asti in July.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>From this moment, long pages of the manuscript
account book of Chassenage are filled with lists of
captains, men-at-arms, and archers. Archers under
Braguet, archers, under Viezville, a concentration of
devoted Orleanists, once Angevines, in Italy. Italian
names, also, begin to crop up in the French harvest:
Messire Othe Tusque, des parties d’Italie, Messire
Jehan Visconti, escuier, Messire Aloyset de Plaisance,
also Luquin Rusque, Francesquin Martin demourant
à Pavey, Hannibal Lommelin of Genoa and his troop,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>others from as far as Florence and Venice. Then a
great name, commander of many others, a name that
means business: <em>Messire Facin Can and his company</em>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The red towers of Asti—still here and there existing,
a bouquet of wine-red stems slenderly streaking
the pale and radiant Lombard sky—the red towers of
Asti, innumerable then, grew home-like and familiar
to many a French lord. No dreary exile this—large
houses, wine-red also (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“non hanno acqua ma vino per
impetrargli,“</span> laugh the men of Alba), beautiful
churches, a rich plain, streaked with the wide Tanaro,
and girt with hills. At night, the Alps come out,
invisible by day; they appear at sundown even as a
rose-red heavenly wall divinely dividing the Lombard
country from the unseen land of France.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet here are the French and quite at home. Plenty
of wine, red and white; beautiful women; plenty of
money. Orleans pays fifteen francs a month to every
man-at-arms (but a man-at-arms, we must remember,
is more than a man, being at least the soldier himself,
his page and his varlet), eight francs a month to every
archer; two hundred francs a month to Chassenage
and the chamberlains; four hundred and fifty to
Enguerrand de Coucy. All this serves at least to
bring wealth and custom to Puielhez, mine host of
the Cross of Asti, who supplies the wine. But for
what other purpose does Orleans thus dissipate his
new-got treasure? The “Dance of Fools,” sculptured
on a wall in the market place, by some gay ironic
band not long dead then, looks down with silent bells
and silent laughing lips that answer not.</p>

<p class='c006'>In August, Orleans sends one of his men (Blaru),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>on a secret embassy to his father-in-law at Milan,
another (Craon) to the Antipope Clement.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a> They
have scarcely gone when he sends another (Garancières)
to Pavia. In February of the next year (1390)
there is much prate at Court of a voyage to Italy—voyage
being then the polite name for an invasion—in
order to establish Pope Clement in his see of Rome.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now, little by little, the great plan disengages
itself—audacious, simple, as befits the brain of Visconti.
Orleans and Burgundy themselves start for
Pavia, and arrive there in March, 1391. Brilliant
Visconti, to have persuaded Burgundy that the expansion
of Orleans in Italy will leave him free to extend
his grasp at home! Great things also, as we know
from a passage in Walsingham,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a> are vaguely held out to
Burgundy. As for Orleans, there are no bounds to his
ardour; he defrays the entire expense of the journey,
60,000 francs, lavished magnificently to astound his
new ally and his subjects of Asti. The Royal Dukes
remain but a week in Lombardy, and then return—recalled
by rumours of Armagnac’s disturbance. But
the week was long enough.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first step of the affair was to persuade Giangaleazzo
Visconti to give in his adherence to the Antipope
Clement. The Lord of Milan was still in name
an Urbanite; but he had suffered the Antipope
Clement to arrange the marriage of his daughter and
to grant the dispensation that made it lawful; and
his wife Caterina was a devoted Clementine. Visconti
gives it to be understood that he will fight for Clement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>if it be made worth his while. Meanwhile the king
takes fire:—honest, practical, religious, the idea of thus
forcibly putting an end to heresy and schism greatly
commends itself to him. There were three Royal visits
to Avignon that year. The Antipope suggests to
Charles VI. an Imperial Crown for a second Charlemagne.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
Froissart hears of the royal intention,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“de mener notre Saint Père à Rome,“</span> and on the
23rd of February, 1391, the King signs a quittance of
2,000 francs, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“pour nous aider à abiller et mestre est
estat pour aller en la compagnie d’icelui seigneur au
voyage qu’il a intencion de faire au païs de Lombardie.”</span></p>

<p class='c006'>But nothing can be done without the indispensable
Visconti. What is his plan? At first he holds back,
loving by nature the attitude of suspense. But in
1392 the moment came to decide. Armagnac at that
moment was invading Italy in defence of the rights of
his sister Beatrice and the elder branch of Visconti.
He suffered defeat, indeed, and death at the hands of
Milan, but not before he had inflicted so severe a
check upon his victor that Giangaleazzo no longer
saw his triumph clear. Nay, unwelcome as the ghost
of Banquo at the board of Macbeth, the pale figures of
the dead Armagnac, the once laughing Beatrice, the
poisoned Bernabò, intrude themselves between him
and his end. Do not such sights as these clamour for
revenge?—and Armagnac and Beatrice have a living
brother; Bernabò Visconti has left a troop of sons.
Milan may yet be snatched from his grasp. He is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>safe in Lombardy, and he would fain be King of Italy.
But how to obtain that crown? Already Armagnac has
forced him to restore Padua to the Carraresi. And
Florence, the irreconcileable enemy, is grouping round
her a league of hostile states. In August, 1392,
Florence, Padua, Faenza, Ravenna—a little later the
Malatestas and Forli—are united against Visconti.
He is not safe in Milan till he wear the crown of
Florence too.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then he sends to the Pope and to the King of France
and announces his plan. How did the Lord of Milan
hear of the secret Adrian project? Did Anjou,
passing through Pavia, drop a word? Did one of the
many Angevines sheltered in the house of Orleans,
familiar with Asti and Milan, broach the plan? We
know not, but this was the scheme of Visconti: <em>Naples
for Anjou</em>; <em>Rome for the Frenchman Clement VII.</em>;
<em>Adria</em>, that is to say the centre of Italy from Spoleto
to Ferrara, and from Massa to Ancona, <em>Adria for
Orleans, the North for Visconti</em>. That is to say, Italy
for the father of Valentine and his allies.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a> As Walsingham
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>tells us Visconti secured for himself the
double crown of Tuscany and Lombardy. But in the
very moment when the reluctant Pope (less hasty and
less egoistic now than at Sperlonga), had promised
thus to alienate the Church lands as the price of his
restoration, a Divine Hand, as it must have seemed,
interposed to save the Church. On the 28th of August,
1394, Pope and Cardinals had approved the Schedule
of Orleans. A fortnight later, on the 16th of September,
suddenly, Clement VII. died at Avignon.</p>

<p class='c006'>His successor was less able; and the scheme of
Adria was abandoned. Valentine would never reign
as Queen of Adria. Yet, as Duchess of Genoa, she
would be nearer home. Then in all manner of subtle
and secret ways Orleans and Visconti immediately
manœuvred to secure the Ligurian province. Armies
in the field, diplomats in the Cabinet, worked for one
end alone. In November, 1394, Savona had submitted
to Orleans. Now Genoa must be gained. The young
Duke had already a strong faction in his favour. The
Lomellini, Spinole, Flischi, figure in the rolls of
Orleans’ army.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a> But, at the same time, they were
intriguing with an unsuspected enemy.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c014'><sup>[29]</sup></a> In August,
1395, the Doge of Genoa sent to Paris offering to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Charles himself the suzerainty of Genoa. There was
in France a strong current of popular opinion running
in favour of Italian colonization. Why should
Orleans have Genoa?—asked the people. Why not
the King? Why not all of us? Why not France?
The King, as we know, was never a very solid creature.
Honest, but feeble, he let himself be dominated by
the nearest influence. The Duke of Burgundy was in
Paris, and he, it is probable, persuaded Charles<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a> to
abandon his brother and to accept the gift of the
Doge. In October, Genoa was united to the Crown of
France. In December the King bought from Orleans
his rights in Savona and Genoa.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a> This was checkmate
both to Orleans and Visconti.</p>

<p class='c006'>Burgundy and the Queen were triumphant. The
Queen wrote to the Florentines that affairs were going
well, that her enemy and theirs was fallen in disgrace,
and on the 29th December the King joined the
Florentines against his late ally. For there was
now great irritation in France against Visconti,
who, furious at the treachery which had outwitted
his plans for Genoa, played a double game with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>France. Signing with one hand a fraternal alliance
with King Charles,<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a> with the other he stirred up the
Genoese to rebel against his yoke. But the Genoese
suspected his counsels, and revealed the whole intrigue
to the Court of Paris. Hence fury among the
nobles, an ardent desire to punish the false friend.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a>
Hence among the populace the best will in the world
to believe the Duke of Milan a wizard and his
daughter a witch, an infernal spirit bringing death
and madness upon the beloved King.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>IX.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Thus the machinations of Milan served to exasperate
the French. And the indignity and insult
offered to Valentine were as great a cause of irritation
to Visconti. He and his daughter, with their Lombard
indifference to <a id='corr148.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='superstitition'>superstition</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_148.17'><ins class='correction' title='superstitition'>superstition</ins></a></span>, could have nothing
but contempt for the panic of the French. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Et
l’une des plus dolentes et courroucées qui y fust,
c’estoit la Duchesse d’Orleans,“</span> writes Juvenal des
Ursins. Twice or thrice the Duke of Milan sent his
ambassadors to the King of France, offering to find
a knight to fight at outrance with any man who
would accuse Madame Valentine of any treason. So
sore and angry were the father and the brother-in-law
of Valentine that there was a talk of a Milanese
invasion. Great counter preparations were made in
France, and the League was signed with the Florentines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>against Milan. The King, being in good health
then, went to Boulogne to celebrate the marriage of his
daughter Isabel, a child of seven, with Richard II. of
England, a man some years older than himself.
Richard was very bitter against Milan. He offered to
send an English contingent to the King’s aid, if he
invaded Lombardy. He warned the King again and
again against the spells and sorceries of Lombardy;
and he produced so strong an impression upon the
enfeebled mind of Charles, that on the 29th of October,
as the two kings were sitting together at dinner, the
King of France perceiving among the heralds one with
the Serpent of Milan on his shield, had him stripped of
his arms, menaced with death, and chased out of the
royal presence. The Duke of Milan retaliated with
the famous Investiture of 1396, which excludes the
children of Valentine of Orleans from the succession
to Milan. With things at this pitch of hostility, war
seemed imminent, and the route was made out for the
invasion of Lombardy. But that war never took
place. “And that journey,” <a id='corr149.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='say'>says</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_149.21'><ins class='correction' title='say'>says</ins></a></span> Froissart, “took none
effect; for the discomfiture of the battle before Nicopoly
in Turkey, and the death and the taking of the
Lords of France. And also they saw well that the
Duke of Milan was in favour with the Great Turk,
Lamorabaquy; wherefore they durst not displease
him, so let him alone.” It became immediately
necessary to make peace with Milan,<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c014'><sup>[32]</sup></a> the one power
in Europe that could mediate with Turkey. The ambassadors
of the King, Burgundy, Orleans, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Sultan, caused a continual come-and-go in Milan.
Visconti took his position of peace-maker in good part.
In March, 1397, he procured a third and less hostile
investiture. The talk of magic was hushed for a
while, and Valentine returned in peace to Court.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet now, perhaps, for the first time the French
people, not unjustifiably, might have heaped their
odium on Valentine. For her latest historian supports
a theory suggested long ago by Froissart.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c014'><sup>[35]</sup></a> While
the French were projecting their invasion of Lombardy—while
the son of that Burgundy who had
advised the King in the affair of Genoa was leading
against the Turks a French Crusade which might
easily return homewards <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>viâ</em></span> Lombardy and Milan—Giangaleazzo,
furious and humiliated, sought any
means of salvation and revenge. He, like many
another Italian, was in correspondence with the Turk;
and an idea, successfully practised by many another
Italian,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a> may not unnaturally have suggested itself
to him. If France joined the Florentine League then
adieu for ever to the hopes of Visconti. And Burgundy,
as he knew, was in favour of Florence. And the son
of Burgundy was captain of the French army. Small
hope here; yet, if the French army could be destroyed
in Turkey, Milan would be safe! Then the
astute Visconti would smile to think of his daughter
in France. Valentine who wrote him everything—also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>told him doubtless (as the author of Maistre
Jehan de Meun tells us<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a>) of the vain young aristocrats,
ruined by free living and fine carousing, who were
starting on that terrible journey, thinking of nothing
more serious than the elegant spectacle of their
departure:</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>But the panoply of these splendid youths—these <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>gens
de paraige</em></span>—was for decoration rather than for battle.
Valentine, the confidant of her father—who in the long
afternoons of exile would turn with the expansion of
relief to her one kinsman, her staunch protector—would
tell him of the weakness that underlay the glory
of this martial going-off. She would write to him the
plan of campaign, the route decided on, the means of
attack and defence. She would inform him not only
of the quality but of the number of the army. And
Giangaleazzo was aware that these details transmitted
to the Turks would ensure the disaster of the French,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>and draw away the gathering storm that threatened to
break on Milan.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Duke of Milan was not scrupulous; he was
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“moult bien”</span> in the friendship of the Turk. The
Turk gained a singular acquaintance with the disposition
of the French army. No need to dwell here on the
terrible disaster of that unforgotten battle: the twelve
to twenty thousand dead; the rare fugitives stealing
homewards, dukes and barons, in the dress of beggar-men;
the harder lot of those taken by the Turks, sold
into slavery, or massacred in vengeance for the Faithful
slain at Christian hands; of the heartsick waiting of
the few—a very few, of the richest and noblest—set
aside for ransom. One of these, Jacques de Heilly, was
sent by the Sultan on parole to France, to inform the
King of the disaster and to bring back the news of their
intentions with respect to ransom. He was bidden to
pass by Milan<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a> in order to convey to Giangaleazzo
Visconti the salutations of the Sultan. On Christmas
night he arrived in Paris; the Court were feasting and
dancing. In the prison of the Châtelet, hungry and
cold, there were men who spent their Christmas in a
dungeon for having spread false news, as it was said, of
a great defeat in Turkey. But the tale of D’Heilly told,
all that was changed: the prisoners were freed, the
Court was in tears. The bells rang in all the churches
for the dead. The universal thought was how to
redeem the flower of France from a savage captivity.
On the 20th of January, 1397, a French embassy was
sent to Milan. A few days earlier Jacques de Heilly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>laden with propitiatory gifts, had returned to the
Sultan. Nothing was spoken of but mediation and
reconciliation. And Valentine—so long the innocent
scapegoat of her party—was recalled to favour in the
very hour when all men might have suspected her as
the involuntary origin of misery.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>X.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Actual war with Milan was averted; but the
rumours against the King’s brother continued still in
France.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 24th of March, 1403, Ives Gilemme, a
priest; Demoiselle Marie de Blansy, Perrin Hémery,
a locksmith, and Guillaume Floret, a clerk, were publicly
burned for sorcery. And still the King was mad.
Were those who bewitched <em>him</em>, the head of the State,
to keep their immunity? There <em>was</em> such a crime as
witchcraft, and people legally suffered for it. The
King was bewitched: who was the wizard?</p>

<p class='c006'>To this incessant question Burgundy ever helped to
point the answer. Who was the person who profited
most by the sickness of the King?</p>

<p class='c006'>The Duke of Orleans had become very powerful. In
January, 1393, an ordonnance had promised him the
Regency in case of the death of the King.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a> His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>prestige, his wealth, his faction increased with every
year. This young man who, in 1385, possessed
no more than 12,000 livres a year, was Duke of
Orleans (1391), Count of Valois and Count of Beaumont
(1386), Count of Asti and Count of Vertus
(1387), Count of Soissons (1391), Count of Blois
(1391), Count of Dreux, Count of Angoulême (1394).
In 1394 he was very nearly King of Adria. He was
Count of Perigord in 1398. He was Seigneur of
Savona (1394), Seigneur of Coucy (1391); he
possessed both lands and castles in Hainault, at
Pierrefonds, and at Ferté-Millon (1392). The Duchy
of Luxembourg (1402), the Duchy of Aquitaine (1407)
lay immediately before him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The princes of Europe appealed to the Duke of
Orleans as to an independent sovereign. The Duke of
Guelders concluded a separate alliance with him
(1401). The King of the Romans offered him for his
son the heiress of Bohemia, Hungary, and Poland
(1397). Henry of Lancaster, an exile in Paris (1399),
paid more court to him than to the King of France.
And in 1405 the Venetians sent two secret ambassadors
to Orleans, who in return despatched a certain
Pierre de Scrovignes with private despatches to the
Signory of Venice. Since 1401 the Venetians had
never sent a message to the King. Burgundy began
to fear that Orleans would induce the new Antipope at
Avignon to depose Charles VI. in his own favour.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is, I think, no evidence of such an intention,
and yet the suspicions of Burgundy may not impossibly
have been correct. In 1400 the Germans
deposed their drunken Wenzel, in 1398 the English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>had deposed their incapable Richard. Why should
not France depose a king continually lapsing into
madness? In the year 1399 the king had six relapses.
Orleans may have been no less ambitious
than his sworn friend and brother, Henry of Lancaster,
who had so lately conquered for himself the
throne of England.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c006'>Orleans and Burgundy turn by turn usurped the
direction of affairs. Vainly King and Queen and
Court attempted to assuage their rivalry. On the 14th
of June, 1401, the Queen of France (the King being
mad), the King of Sicily, the Dukes of Berri and
Bourbon, made a League <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“pour apaiser les Ducs
d’Orlèans et de Bourgogne.”</span><a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a> In vain. The King
himself was powerless, and could only bid his subjects—as
in 1405 he bade the Bailly de Caux—to
stand aside and take no part nor lot in the discord
existing between the Dukes of Orleans and Burgundy.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a>
This impartiality was only apparent. The growing
influence of Burgundy was dreaded by Berri and the
Queen, no less than by Orleans himself. And in the
winter of 1405, these three persons joined themselves
together in an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Alliance défensive et réciproque, pour
se maintenir au pouvoir.”</span><a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a> Thus, if Burgundy had
the nation on his side, the authority of the Queen,
the influence of Valentine (all-powerful with the
King), was with Orleans. In 1404 Philip of Burgundy
died, and his faction gained new vigour with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>accession of his son, a man less temperate, less
aristocratic than his father. The blood of his
Flemish mother worked in the veins of the young
man, restless, violent, demagogic as a burgher
of Ghent. The young Duke of Burgundy had no
woman to work for him; it was even rumoured
that the portrait of his own wife hung in that
locked chamber where Orleans kept the pictures of
his mistresses. But Jean-sans-Peur did not need any
feminine advocate. He was young, he was rich. In
1404 his father’s death bequeathed him Burgundy,
next year his mother died and left him Flanders. A
small ugly man, alert, blunt, brutal even, serving
public interests to reach his own ends, Jean-sans-Peur
of Burgundy was the hero of the people. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Brun et
barbu et bien aimé,“</span> writes Burcarius.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile the people groaned under the tyranny of
Orleans. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Jugum intollerabile plebis.</em></span> And Orleans, sceptical
and embittered, had no respect and no pity for
the ignorant populace that reviled him, that menaced
his virtuous wife, that mocked the death of his little
child with cruel and insulting calumnies. The people
to him were odious, or, at best, indifferent; a cup to
drain, a fruit to squeeze and throw away the rind.
In 1403 he laid upon them an impost of three hundred
thousand crowns. Out of this he builded for
himself two famous castles, Pierrefonds and Ferté-Millon,
beautiful as the towers of heaven in a picture
by Van Eyck.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1407, not content, he levied a new tax. The
money thus gained enriched the State far less than
him, and great personages accused him and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Queen of leaving no single florin to rattle in the
empty treasury. When Orleans suggested the new
impost, Jean-sans-Peur opposed him in the royal
council: “I ask pity of the poor people. It is
tyranny to aggravate their intolerable yoke.” Jean-sans-Peur
declared that, in <em>his</em> domains at least, the
impost should not be collected; rather would he forfeit
the entire amount himself. Struck by this
generosity, the young Duke of Brittany volunteered
to postpone his wife’s dowry until the treasury was
full again.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tax was levied all the same. It was a war
levy, and really necessary. Every man and woman
in France was mulcted according to the value of his
goods. In this way a vast sum was raised—twenty-seven
millions. It was lodged in a tower of the
Louvre. One night, when the town was quiet,
Orleans, with a band of armed men, entered this
tower and carried off at least two-thirds of the
treasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the people heard of it—the people who (the
Monk assures us) had sold the straw of their beds to
pay the levy—they prayed publicly in every town and
hamlet: “Jesus Christ in heaven, send thou some
one to deliver us from Orleans!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Orleans smiled no less bitterly than when he had
heard the public whisper accuse him of sorcery and
devil-worship. He proclaimed that whosoever did not
pay the taxes should be cast into prison; to prevent
assassination, no man was to carry another knife
than he used for his eating; a fourth of the provisions
of the royal household was to be supplied daily,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>without payment, by the people of Paris. These
provisions, as the people knew very well, did not go
to feed or clothe their beloved King. He, in his
palace, was as poor, as suffering as themselves. The
Dauphin was no richer: “in penury and want,” says
the Monk, “if such words may be used for so great
a personage.” The insatiable Orleans, the avid little
Queen, grasped and kept everything. “Jesus Christ
in heaven,” prayed the people, “send some one to
deliver us from the Duke of Orleans.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Orleans should have listened. The air was full of
warnings to tyrants. Richard and Wenzel had fallen
miserably. The Duke of Milan had died of the
plague; in six months his vast kingdom had fallen
into ruins. Tyranny is, so often, a personal accident—a
possession, not an inheritance. Was it worth
while? The King himself added to the list of these
monitions. In August, 1404, he married his eldest
son to Burgundy’s daughter, his daughter to the son
of Burgundy.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the year 1405, on Ascension Day, the people
found a voice. An Augustine monk, Jacques Legrand,
preached then before the Court. The Queen,
Valentine, and Orleans were present, but not the
King. “O Queen! O Duke!” said the monk, “you
are the curse and derision of your people. Do you
not believe me? Go into the streets and hear them!</p>

<p class='c006'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Tua curia, Domina Venus solium occupans</em></span>, thy
court, O Queen! where Lady Venus fills the throne,
thy Court, by day and night, is the scene of debauch
and drunkenness. Dissolute dances do honour to the
goddess. Frequent bathing enervates your bodies.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Fringes to your sleeves, and long sleeves to your garments;
yet are ye clothed upon with the sighs and
tears of the poorest of your people. Your hearts are
corrupt and your minds are all unmoved: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Domina
Venus solium occupat</em></span>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a flutter of indignation in the Court.
The monk’s sermon was reported to the King, but to
the surprise of all, Charles answered that he was
glad of it. On Whit-Sunday Legrand was commanded
to preach again, and in the royal presence. The
monk repeated his sermon, but with larger reference
to a certain noble duke, “once good and dear, but
hated now for his oppression and his vice.” The
King left his chair and sat down face to face with the
monk, listening earnestly, who can tell with what
cruel suspicions, what resolutions for inquiry and
reform, in his dim and altered mind. When the
sermon was over, the King spoke to Legrand for
some moments. He thanked him earnestly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Charles was deeply impressed with the words of
the Augustine friar. Struggling against continual
relapses, he made a brave effort to do the best he
could for his disordered kingdom. When Orleans
asked for the government of Normandy, for the first
time he was refused. Another day the poor King
called the Dauphin to him. “How long, my lad, is
it since your mother kissed you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Three months,” the boy replied.</p>

<p class='c006'>The King was much affected. His children were
evidently pinched, neglected, uncared for. He called
the boy’s nurse to him, and gave her a gold cup.
“Look after my son when I am ill. If God grant
me life I will reward you later.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>This was in July, 1405. Burgundy was absent on
his own estates. The King wrote to him and implored
him to return to Paris.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orleans and the Queen were at St. Germains. They
paid no heed to any warning. On the 13th of July
there was a fearful storm; torrents of rain, eddies of
wind. The Queen and Orleans were riding in the
forest when they were overtaken by the tempest. The
Duke took refuge in the Queen’s litter, but the
frightened horses nearly drowned them in the Seine.
The people declared that it was the judgment of
heaven upon tyrants, and Orleans himself appeared
impressed. He sent a herald to Paris, and proclaimed
that whosoever of his creditors should come
on Sunday next to the Hôtel de Behaigne should
have his debt discharged in full. On Sunday the
halls and anterooms of the ducal palace were crowded
with eager burghers. Many, tired and anxious, had
travelled from the provinces. The Duke’s stewards
laughed in their face and shut the doors. This
was the final touch to the exasperation of the people.</p>

<p class='c006'>All this while Jean-sans-Peur was travelling to Paris.
He came at the head of six thousand men-at-arms.
The King was mad again, and could not support him;
but none the less the Queen and Orleans feared an
insurrection in Burgundy’s favour. They decided to
flee secretly away into Luxembourg with the royal
children. Valentine was with them; and they had
got as far as Pouilly when the troops of Burgundy
suddenly surrounded the litter of the Dauphin, some
hours’ journey to the rear. The boy was delighted;
he embraced his father-in-law, and was carried in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>triumph back to Paris. Isabel, with Valentine and
Orleans, fled to the Castle of Melun. Civil war
seemed eminent; but when the two armies were
actually in the field, peace was arranged, and on the
15th of October the Queen and Orleans re-entered Paris.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orleans had learned nothing by his lesson. He
was more than ever arrogant, more than ever secure
in his tyranny. Early in the next year his young
son Charles was married to the King’s daughter
Isabel, the widowed Queen of England, a girl of sixteen.
In the first months of 1407 the King gave his
brother the rich duchy of Aquitaine. Orleans began
to think again of the governorship of Normandy. He
was richer and stronger than the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>And yet, if Valentine, if Orleans, had really read
the future as the people thought they did, or had they
even cared to read the present, they might well have
paused. In that age the fate of tyrants was not
prosperous. The King of England was a leper. The
King of France was mad. The little Duke of Milan
was mad also, with a furious Italian hemomania. The
King of Scotland was a prisoner in the hands of his
enemies. There were two Popes, things for scorn and
laughter, held in derision of all nations, and a song
to the people all day long.</p>

<p class='c006'>Already, in 1380, Miles de Dormans, Chancellor of
France, had declared “A government has no force
save in the obedience of the people, for kings only
rule by the suffrage of their subjects: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Nam et si
centies negent, reges regnant suffragio populorum</em></span>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The judgment of heaven, the liberties of man,
seemed to conspire alike against the rule of tyrants.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>XI.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Notwithstanding his deceptions in the affair of
Genoa, and in spite of his supremacy in France,
Orleans still cherished designs on Lombardy; and
perhaps the chief cause why his Italian enterprises
are less noticeable in the fifteenth than in the
seventeenth century is due, not so much to his engrossment
with affairs at home, as to the fact that in
Benedict XIII. he found an ally infinitely less subtle
and less brilliant than he had known in Clement VII.
Benedict was little more than a captive in the hands
of Orleans;<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c014'><sup>[41]</sup></a> Clement had been an accomplice.</p>

<p class='c006'>A greater than Clement failed him a little later.
In the autumn of 1402, in the very flush and zenith
of victory, Giangaleazzo Visconti died. A score of
his captains soon were fighting for his kingdom.
That vast territory, whose coherence existed only in
the brain of one man, fell rapidly into fragments: city
after city threw off the unwilling yoke of union, and
what had almost begun to be a national Italy reverted
in a few weeks to the old conditions of fragmentary
independence. His two sons ruled in a narrowed
Lombardy, and with no vista, as it seemed, on the
ambitions of their father. In the very same year that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>the great Visconti died, Charles VI. sent to Genoa a
small, restless, quixotic man of much ability, who to
some extent filled the empty place of the dead Giangaleazzo.
But if Marshal Boucicaut had much of
the ambition, and all the audacity of the late Duke of
Milan, he possessed nothing of his slow wise mind,
of the deep and subtle duplicity that Machiavelli may
have envied, or of the powers of combination, the
cool tenacity to a grand idea, which foreshadowed the
genius of another North Italian, Count Cavour.
Moreover, while such share as Visconti meant to
allow the French in Italy was destined by him for his
son-in-law of Orleans, Boucicaut worked for the King.
Thus, for the second time in his experience, the
Frenchman found his greatest rival in France.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the two legitimate sons of the great Duke of
Milan—one was a handsome young Nero, blood-mad,
inept, given over to passion and cruelty; the other
an astute child, timid, unscrupulous, who later should
develop a trace of the genius of his father. At first
their hold on their inheritance was so slight that
Orleans determined on invading Lombardy, whether
to defend or to supplant his nephews, who shall
say? In October, 1403, he started for Lombardy,
accompanied by 13 knights-banneret, 43 knights,
212 squires, 28 archers, 20 crossbow-men, and
other soldiers.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a> On the way south he passed by
Beaucaire, and had an interview with his charge,
the Antipope Benedict. He took into his service the
famous captain of adventure, Bernardon de Serres.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>He made friends with another mighty captain—an
ancient enemy—the Count of Armagnac.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c014'><sup>[42]</sup></a> Vast and
serious appeared his project of invasion, but, on the
very verge of the Alps, suddenly, on January, 1404,
he abandoned the prosperous enterprise, turned right
about, and faced home for Paris.</p>

<p class='c006'>What is the meaning of this sudden change of
course, unexplained, and perhaps inexplicable?
What was the object of the Lombard invasion?
What was the cause which so unexpectedly suppressed
it? Orleans believed himself to have a
certain claim on Pisa, bequeathed by the great
Visconti to his bastard son Gabriello-Maria. Gabriello
Visconti was ill at ease in Pisa. A little later,
in 1404, as we know, he offered his unruly city first
to France, then to Florence. It is possible—it is
even from the nature of things a necessary hypothesis—to
suppose that in 1403 Gabriello had come to
terms with Orleans, and that the rights on Pisa which
Orleans vaunted as his own through Valentine Visconti
were supported by some cession of the actual
lord, her half-brother. But Orleans was not the only
Frenchman capable of adventure and practice in
Italy. By the time his army reached the frontier he
found himself outwitted by a higher bidder, nearer at
hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jehan le Meingre, Marshal Boucicaut, Governor
of Genoa, had intrigued with Gabriello and procured
the city of Pisa for the King. A few months
later, on the 15th of April, 1404,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c014'><sup>[44]</sup></a> a deed was
drawn up declaring Pisa henceforth a fief of France.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>At the first word of the matter Orleans had turned
his back on his contemplated campaign and marched
back to Paris, fury in his heart. Probably behind the
interference of Boucicaut he divined the inspiration
of Burgundy, his enemy;—Burgundy who, as
events should prove, had unsuspected designs of his
own upon the State of Pisa. Back in wrath marched
Orleans: stalked indignant into Paris his men at his
heels: found the King in his senses, and docile as
was his wont. From him, on the 24th of May, Orleans
extracted the deed which we append,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a> a deed that repudiates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the action of Boucicaut, and transfers all
the rights of France in Pisa to Orleans, who henceforth
shall meet with neither let nor hindrance in his
projects.</p>

<p class='c006'>The deed was granted in Council, the King being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>then in his senses, and assisted by Berri, Bourbon,
Tancarville, and others. The reader will remark the
noteworthy absence of Burgundy. He will remember
also that Berry, in 1405, will join Orleans in a defensive
league against Jean-sans-Peur. It is possible
that Burgundy knew nothing of the deed drawn up
behind his back.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it was too late for Orleans to profit by the
King’s good-will. The Florentines were in Pisa, and
an invasion against so powerful an enemy could not
be undertaken.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a moment Orleans was obliged to pause in his
Italian policy—to pause only, not to abandon it, since
in 1406<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c014'><sup>[48]</sup></a> he still reclaimed authority on Pisa, and in
the very year of his death was taking an active part
in the affairs of Lombardy.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c014'><sup>[47]</sup></a> That pause was filled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>in a manner disastrous, fatal, yet natural enough in
a man suffocating under a sense of bitter indignation
and revolt. Burgundy had interfered with Orleans
abroad. Very well; Orleans would interfere with
Burgundy at home. Already the first steps were
taken. In 1401, Orleans had married his cousin
Mary Harcourt to the Duke of Gueldres, the enemy
and the neighbour of Burgundy, with whom his rival
now concluded an alliance and a league. In 1402,
Orleans purchased from the King of the Romans the
Duchy of Luxembourg. In 1405,<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c014'><sup>[46]</sup></a> he assembled at
Melun the entire strength of his faction, sending even
to Asti for the Governor and his men. In 1405 also
he allied himself with Berri and the Queen against
Jean-sans-Peur. With the Court on one hand, and
on the other Gueldres, the most reckless captain of
his age;—with an army at his heels, and (through the
county of Soissons, and down the banks of the Oise
and the Marne), an uninterrupted passage through
his own possessions into his new Duchy of Luxembourg:
Orleans was a deadly enemy to Burgundy. A
glance at the map will show the reader how, like a
wedge or like a rivet, Luxembourg must split apart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>or hold together the domains of the Netherlands and
the provinces of Franche Comté and Burgundy. In
the hands of Orleans, Luxembourg was a wedge; and
the domains of Burgundy were no longer a compact
and formidable territory, but two principalities with
Brussels for the capital of the one, and Dijon for the
capital of the other. Should Orleans march an army
into Luxembourg, should Gueldres come to his aid
with an armed force, the suppression of the Dukedom
of Burgundy would fall within the range of practical
politics.</p>

<p class='c006'>Henceforth, between these two princes the struggle
for power should take on a new character and become
the very struggle for existence. And while the people,
abject, all in tears, prayed to Heaven: “Jesu Christ,
send thou some man to deliver us from Orleans,” the
hero of the people, Jean-sans-Peur the Belovèd, was
urged by every motive of self-interest, every instinct
of self-preservation, and with the assurance of popular
immunity, to interrupt for ever the fatal progress of
the tyrant.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>XII.</h3>

<p class='c016'>One Wednesday evening—it was St. Clement’s day,
the 23rd of November, 1407—Orleans was supping
with the Queen. Isabel was ill and dispirited. Ten
days ago her new-born baby had died at its birth, and
she sorrowed for this child and loved it as she had
never loved her other children. Isabel was away from
her husband in her new Hôtel de Montaigu, near the
Porte Barbette. It was here that Orleans came every
day to see her, and here they “supped right joyously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>together,” says the Monk of St. Denis. Orleans had
been ill all autumn at his Castle of Beauté, and had
only recently come back to Paris. Valentine, with her
four children and the Princess Isabel, was still in the
country.</p>

<p class='c006'>As these two persons, both ill, both weary, forgot
their troubles for a while in each other’s company, a
page came to the door with a feigned message: the
King earnestly beseeched his brother to come and see
him at the palace of St. Paul. Orleans arose at once
and left the Queen. He had at least six hundred men
of his own lodged that day in Paris, as Monstrelet informs
us. Orleans, however, took none of them with
him. He leapt on his mule and rode away with two
squires on horseback at his side. Two or three footmen
with torches ran after him. No gentleman could
go more simply than the King’s brother in his plain
suit of black damask, riding with no more than five
attendants, quickly and gaily down the frosty street.
It was the coldest winter ever known, and muffled in
their cloaks the little party rode briskly ahead, looking
neither to the right or left. Orleans was singing
softly to himself and playing with one of his gloves.
He feared no enemies. Last Sunday he had taken
the Sacrament with Burgundy, and yesterday they
two had dined together.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was eight o’clock. All was dark and silent in the
Rue Vieille du Temple, then an outlying and quiet
district. Orleans and his two squires rode along so
fast that the runners with the torches were left some
way behind. At last they came to a wider place in
the street where there was a well. As the three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>horsemen passed the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de l’Image de Notre-Dame</span>,
seventeen or eighteen men sprang suddenly out of the
shadow of the house. One with an axe chopped off
the bridle hand of Orleans. The King’s brother gave
a cry of surprise and pain. “I am the Duke of
Orleans!” “It is he we seek.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In another moment the Duke was beaten off his
mule on to the frozen paving-stones. Seventeen
axes were aimed at him; blow after blow fell heavily;
his head was cloven, his brains gushed out into the
street. His servants had all fled and left him there,
save one of his squires who had been his page (a
German, says Monstrelet; a Fleming, says the Monk),
who, more constant than Orleans’ compatriots, flung
himself upon the body of his master, and was pierced
and slaughtered there. When both were murdered
the assassins dragged the body of Orleans across the
street, propped it up against a heap of mud that was
standing frozen there, and lighting a torch of straw,
they looked to see if he were really dead. A woman,
a cobbler’s wife, looking from a garret window, saw it
all, and set up a shriek of “Murder, murder!”
“Peace, harlot,” cried the armed men in the street,
and began to shoot their arrows at the open casement.
At that moment a man with a scarlet hood drawn
well over his face, came out of the house opposite,
and struck the dead body with his club. “Put out
the light. He’s dead. Let us go.” The eighteen
assassins rode away in great merriment, sowing
caltrops after them; but before they left they set fire
to the house where, for the last fortnight, Jean-sans-Peur
had kept them hidden. The flames of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>burning Hôtel de l’Image streamed up through the
darkness of the night, awakening the city, and
shedding a strange light on the murdered body of
Orleans, still propped up in a sitting posture, his
wounded head hanging on one side. Just then a
nephew of Maréchal de Rieulx, whose great Hôtel
stood opposite, a young man, one of Orleans’ squires,
rode up as he left his uncle’s house, and saw his master
sitting thus dead, the left hand off, the right arm
hanging by a thread. A little distance off, on the
stones of the street, lay the page, dying in his faithful
youth, murmuring still in his German language,
“Ach, my master!” At his side, on the ground,
was a white hand severed from the wrist. Close by
there lay a fallen glove. The young squire gave the
alarm and the dead bodies were carried into the Hôtel
de Rieulx.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was wailing and mourning in the house of
Orleans, grief and horror in the house of the King.
The deed was soon known, though as yet it was only
surmised that one Raoul d’Actonville, a dismissed
steward, had wreaked in this ghastly fashion his spite
against his master. The next day the royal princes,
all in black, with a great multitude of the people of
Paris, brought the murdered Duke to the church of
St. Guillaume, close at hand. He who had ever
loved the good through all his wickedness, lay now
among the watching friars, who sang psalms and
repeated vigils day and night for his soul; there he
lay until they took him to be buried in his own
chapel of the Celestines, which is called the Blancs-Manteaux
to-day. The people followed him with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>torches, remembering only his gay and gracious
qualities, his capricious generosity, his gentle raillery,
his rhetoric and eloquence, how he had loved learning,
and that he had often lived as a monk for days
among the Celestines. All Paris wept, those also
who had prayed Jesus Christ in heaven to deliver
them from Orleans; even Burgundy went in the
funeral procession, all in black, weeping also. But
when the funeral was over Jean-sans-Peur took Berri
and the King of Sicily aside: “I had it done. I
slew him. It was an inspiration of the demon’s.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>XIII.</h3>

<p class='c016'>There were two women, who were not at the
burial, to whom the death of Orleans came nearer
than to any mourner there. When Isabel heard
that Orleans was slain she went in terror of her
life. Ill as she was, she had herself carried in a
litter to St. Paul’s, taking shelter there in the arms
of her mad husband, and so soon as she was fit for
travel the poor, light, beautiful, little Queen went out
of Paris, far away from Burgundy, far, too, from that
maimed and slaughtered body lying in the chapel of
the Celestines. Terrified, indifferent, she could think
of nothing but her own imaginary danger.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mistress and the wife took the matter in a very
different spirit. At first, in her transports of sorrow,
Valentine could not act. She tore out her hair and
shred her garments; she sobbed so much, that for
weeks afterwards her voice was hoarse. But when
the first paroxysm was over her strong Italian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>character centred itself upon one fixed idea—justice,
vengeance for her murdered husband. Valentine had
no thought of her own safety. She sent her two
elder sons and her girl into Blois, and then, with the
Princess Isabel and little John, her youngest child, on
either hand, the Duchess of Orleans set out from
Château-Thierry for Paris.</p>

<p class='c006'>Travelling was slow that terrible winter. It was
not till the 10th of December that Valentine entered
the capital. She, her children, her servants, were all
dressed very plainly and roughly, and, of course, in
black. The King of Sicily and the Duke of Berri
came out to meet them. When they reached the
palace Valentine threw herself upon her knees before
the King, demanding justice. The poor Charles
(<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>azzez subtil pour lors</em></span>) raised her up and kissed her,
while they both wept together. He promised strict
justice upon Burgundy. Again, ten days later, he
declared, “What is done to my only brother is done
to me.” Valentine and her children, satisfied of
vengeance, retired to their great hotel in the Marais.</p>

<p class='c006'>The King fell ill again so soon as Valentine had
left him. “They say,... but I affirm nothing,”
suggests the Monk. Valentine the witch stayed on,
however, among the people who had murdered her
husband. One thing that we learn of Valentine at
this moment shows us how profound, how selfless was
her love of Orleans. She sought out his bastard—the
little John, afterwards Count of Dunois, the son
of Mariette de Canny—and brought him up with her
own children. It even seemed as though she loved
him more than the others. Glancing from the poetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Charles, the delicate Philip, the child John, to his
determined and eager little face, she exclaimed,
“None of your brothers is more fit than you to
avenge your father. Nature has cheated me of you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>To avenge your father! This had become the
unique preoccupation of Valentine. But that promised
vengeance tarried long. On the 8th of March
a learned doctor of theology, the chosen advocate of
Burgundy, a certain Maître Jean Petit, excused the
murder of Orleans before the King. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<em>Il est licite
d’occire un Tyran.</em>”</span></p>

<p class='c006'>It was not only of tyranny that the Burgundians
accused their victim. The tremendous accusation of
Jean Petit (which every student of the past has read
in Monstrelet) enumerates attempted regicide, and
secret poisoning, sorcery, necromancy, charms, incantations.
“Sorcery, high treason against God,
and regicide, high treason against the King. There
is also tyranny,” says Maître Jean Petit. It was of
course for this third cause, treason against the people,
that Orleans’ murder was condoned in Paris.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the people never hid their support of Jean-sans-Peur.
Those who had wept at the funeral of
Orleans were ready now to cry again the cry of
Burgundy. The King, whose mind was again overcast,
although he was not actually mad, the King
himself on the 9th of April, 1408, signed letters
patent granting pardon to Jean-sans-Peur. “Our
very dear and well-beloved cousin of Burgundy, <em>who
for the public good and out of faith and loyalty to us,
has caused to be put out of this world our said brother of
Orleans</em>.” This was the last insult to his memory.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Valentine would not brook it; she rallied to the
charge. Though she herself had been seriously implicated
in the tissue of villainy which his murderers
had woven about the memory of her husband, Valentine
had no thoughts to spare for her own safety. All
through July and August she kept agitating against
Burgundy. Bringing her children with her she
sought the King and cried on her knees for justice.
Twenty years’ exile for Burgundy! Her two advocates,
Sérisi and Cousinet pleaded eloquently for her;
refuting the vile accusations of poison and sorcery with
a candour, a logic, a fine and modern spirit worthy of
the intellect of the dead man they defended. It was all
no use. “The Parisians,” says Monstrelet, “loved so
well this Duke of Burgundy; because they believed
that if he undertook the government, he would put
down throughout the kingdom all salt taxes, imposts,
dues, and subsidies which were to the prejudice of the
people.” Though nearly all the royal Princes were
openly on the side of Valentine, the King did not
<em>dare</em> avenge his brother. The Court was impotent
against the people.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the early autumn Valentine left Paris. Life
was over for her. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Rien ne m’est plus. Plus ne
m’est rien,”</span> ran her melancholy motto. Anger and
bereavement and hopeless sorrow had worn her to a
shadow. She took the little Dunois with her children
to the Castle of Blois. There were four of them,
Charles, the Poet, who should be the father of King
Louis XII.; and little John, the grandfather of Francis
I.; Philip, Count of Vertus; and Margaret, in later
years the grandmother of Anne of Brittany. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>children, three of whom should be the grandparents
or great-grandparents of Henri II., Valentine ceaselessly
instructed. All her contemporaries bear
witness to her untiring vigilance over them. “They
are marvellously good, and well-instructed for their
years,” says Monstrelet: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Moult notablement conduits
et indoctrinés.”</span> But there was one lesson, dearer than
the others, that Valentine perpetually taught her
sons. “Avenge your father,” she continually cried.</p>

<p class='c006'>These children, so different in character and
destiny, were the dearer to their mother that she felt
she had not long to love them. Valentine was dying
of a broken heart, “of anger and mourning,” writes
Juvenal; “of anger and impotent vengeance,” says
Monstrelet. Her eyes were quite dim with useless
tears, and still she resented the very grief that
drained her life; for she did not want to leave her
little children and her unaccomplished task. “It was
pitiful,” says Juvenal, “before she died to hearken to
her regrets and her complaints, so piteously she regretted
her children, and a bastard, called John,
whom she could not suffer out of her sight, saying
none of her children was fitter to avenge their
father.”... “Since the tragic end of her husband,”
says the Monk, “this Duchess spent her days
in tears, and many say the bitterness of her heart
induced that unhealthy languor of which she died.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This was in November. Upon St. Clement’s day,
upon that heart-sickening anniversary of her husband’s
murder, Jean-sans-Peur rode into Paris. It
was a triumph. As he passed the people, and their
little children cried, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Noel, noel au bon Duc.”</span></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>It was near a week before the news came down to
Blois. When she heard it, Valentine felt that all
was over. No vengeance was possible. On the 4th
of December the unhappy woman died, with her last
breath entreating her little children never to forget
their father’s murder. But these children were only
children, and they were orphans. The death of Valentine
seemed to secure the triumph of her enemy. Jean-sans-Peur
did not seek to hide his rejoicing: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Car
icelle Duchesse continuoit moult asprement et diligemment
sa poursuitte.“</span> But already Retribution at
her grindstone was sharpening the fatal battle-axe of
Montereau.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r46'>46</a>. A strange document in the Carton K. 55 Arch. Nat.,
under date July 27, 1406, in the form of a letter from the King
in Council (Tancarville <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“et autres”</span> being present), notifies that
that day the King has received conjointly the Dukes of Burgundy
and Orleans, who have made him their united homage
for Pisa. In 1407 the Signory of Florence, having taken Pisa
(a French fief), sent to the King, Orleans, and Burgundy to
justify their conduct. Orleans seized the Florentine ambassadors
and cast them into prison—a high-handed proceeding
which he probably considered warranted by his position as
suzerain of the captive city. In so doing Orleans probably
meant to underline the fact that <em>he</em>, not the King or Burgundy,
was lord of Pisa, though all had claims to suzerainty. There
is a long correspondence on this subject (Archives of Florence,
filza xviii. della Signoria. Cancelleria 27).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f47'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r47'>47</a>. It is in 1407 that the Italian projects of Orleans appear in
vigorous renascence. On the 6th of October he proclaimed himself
Protector of his nephews, Giovanni Maria, Duke of Milan,
and Filippo Maria, Count of Pavia, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“frères de Dame Valentine
épouse du Duc”</span> (Arch. Nat. K. 56, No. 16). He made the
Governor of Asti their guardian, and appeared to meditate an
armed intervention. Was this conduct purely and merely disinterested?
Did Orleans in October at Beauté-sur-Marne contemplate
a great French protectorate in Lombardy of which
he should be the soul and centre? A month later a tragic
silence suddenly interrupted any answer to these questions.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Let us recapitulate.</p>

<p class='c006'>When, on September 16, 1380, Charles V. of France
expired, he left behind him two young sons. One was
twelve years old, tall, stalwart, healthy, amiable; the
other was a lad of nine, less regularly handsome than
his brother, slighter, darker, more agile, more acute,
and more engaging.</p>

<p class='c006'>Charles V. had left his younger son no more than
the pension of a private gentleman; the elder was the
king of France. The dying monarch, a man of many
brothers, had seen the dangers that arise when royal
princes are too rich. But he had died before his
time; and of his two heirs the king was gentle, dull,
and generous; the gentleman, brilliant, grasping,
and ambitious. The result was calculable. Twenty
years later the younger son was king in all but name;
he was rich, puissant, terrible, and hated; while his
brother, impoverished and neglected, starved on the
throne, the best-beloved man in France. Circumstances
had made the rise of the younger son singularly
easy. In his twenty-fourth year King Charles
VI. became violently mad, and henceforward till his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>death there were long regencies (the subject of angry
contests between his uncle and his brother) interrupted
by periods of lax and kindly government. His
younger brother, Louis, Duke of Orleans, became, as
first prince of the blood, more powerful than the king.
He was too powerful; and his arrogance and his
extortions raised many enemies against him. On
November 23, 1407, he was cruelly murdered as he
was riding by night through the streets of Paris. He
had made himself so terrible that even the brother
who loved him did not seek to avenge him, but
praised the murderer “who, for the public good and
out of faith and loyalty to us, has caused to be put
out of this world our said brother of Orleans.” No
one mourned the murdered man absolutely and completely
except his devoted widow and his orphaned
children.</p>

<p class='c006'>A year and a week later the duchess died. Her
three sons, her one daughter, with Dunois, the
natural son of Orleans, whom his widow had adopted,
were left fatherless and motherless in a kingdom full
of enemies, where their father’s murderers triumphed.
They entered the world as a battlefield; but, though
so young, they entered armed and mounted. From
their father they inherited the duchies of Orleans,
Luxembourg, and Aquitaine, the counties of Valois,
Beaumont, Soissons, Blois, Dreux, Périgord, and Angoulême,
with the seigneuries of Coucy and Savona.
Through their mother they acquired the county of
Vertus in Champagne, the county of Asti in Lombardy,
and certain pretensions to the ducal crown of
Milan.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>I.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In the year 1387 their father, Louis of France, not
yet the Duke of Orleans, had been contracted to the
Duke of Milan’s only daughter, Valentine Visconti,
whom two years later he espoused. In relation to
the established monarchs of his time, the father of
Valentine stood in much the same situation as afterwards
the great Napoleon, in the first years of his
empire, towards the kings of Germany. He was rich,
too powerful to be safely opposed, a conqueror of whom
the end was still beyond prediction; hence a man to
conciliate and appease. Yet in their hearts they
despised him as a parvenu and an adventurer, and
deplored and deprecated the moral flaws that marred
the beauty of his prosperity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Giangaleazzo, first Duke of Milan, was the only son
of Galeazzo Visconti, who, in conjunction with Bernabò,
his brother, swayed the city of Milan and the
greater part of Lombardy. They had murdered their
own brother, and divided his inheritance between
them—Bernabò, the elder, holding his state in Milan,
Galeazzo in the city of Pavia.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bernabò had no less than nine-and-twenty children.
Galeazzo had but two, but for these he was
ambitious. He married his daughter to the son of
the King of England; his son he married to the
daughter of the King of France. This was in 1360.
The bride and bridegroom were still of childish age.
Six years later their eldest child was born. It was a
girl, Valentine. The three brothers who followed her
died in their minority; but Valentine flourished, grew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>to womanhood, and brought into the house of Orleans
the tangled question of the Milanese succession.</p>

<p class='c006'>At her birth and during her childhood her father
was but one of several rulers in Milan. The Visconti
ruled as a clan rather than as an organized dynasty.
They were the descendants of a certain Captain Eriprando,
who, in the year 1037, defended Milan against
the Emperor Conrad. Notwithstanding this beginning
the Visconti were eminently Ghibelline, and depended
for all their subsequent fortunes on the emperor. In
1277 they chased the Guelfs from Milan, and made
themselves masters of the state. They became lords
or <em>domini</em> in Milan, lords of an imperial fief, but with
no pretence to an imperial investiture. The emperor
recognized them only as his captains, his viscounts,
or his imperial vicars.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1372 the Emperor Charles IV., alarmed at the
pretensions of the Visconti clan, deprived them of
their office. The rich tyrants, not afraid of a distant
emperor beyond the Alps, paid little heed to this
punishment. The emperor died, and his son succeeded—the
dissolute Wenzel, who was to do so much
for Milan. Almost his first act was to create the
youthful father of Valentine Imperial Vicar of the
Milanese.</p>

<p class='c006'>This taste of power whetted the ambition of the
young man, left fatherless now to confront the faction
of his uncle <a id='corr182.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Bernadò'>Bernabò</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_182.28'><ins class='correction' title='Bernadò'>Bernabò</ins></a></span> and his numerous children.
Lax and irregular forms of government favour a violent
ambition. By one bold stratagem Giangaleazzo took
his uncle prisoner, dispossessed his cousins, and
established himself as lord of Milan.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Milan was not enough. Fire and sword cleared the
way before him, and his territory stretched to the
Apennine ridges. Florence, on the other side,
trembled for her independence. The Lombard kingdom
was alive again, and, though the Pope refused
the indomitable conqueror the title of King of Italy,
in 1395 the Emperor Wenzel invested him with the
duchy of Milan.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile, in 1389, Valentine Visconti had gone
to her husband in France. When she left Milan she
was no longer her father’s only child. A few months
before, her stepmother, Caterina Visconti, had given
birth to a son. A little later a second son was born.
The greatest conqueror of his age could now divide
his possessions between two sons born in wedlock, a
bastard boy named Gabriello, and his only daughter
Valentine, the child of his first wife, the Princess
Isabelle of France. The first question that confronts
us is this: What provision did Giangaleazzo Visconti
make for his daughter Valentine of Orleans?</p>

<p class='c006'>For many centuries there has been much debate
concerning the claim of Orleans to Milan. Much
argument and little evidence has confused the question;
it is only the evidence that we shall examine
here. In the National Archives of Paris<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c014'><sup>[50]</sup></a> there exists
the original marriage-contract of Valentine Visconti.
A copy of this document is contained in a brown
leather folio, stamped with the Visconti serpent, existing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>in the British Museum.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c014'><sup>[49]</sup></a> It is an instrument
granted by the Antipope, Clement of Avignon, on
January 27, 1387, in favour of Louis of Orleans and
Bertrand de Guasche, Governor of Vertus, as representing
the father of Valentine. To the marriage
contract are appended a dispensation (Louis and
Valentine were cousins), a deed of transfer for the
bride’s dowry of Asti and its dependencies, and a
declaration of her right to succeed her father in
Milan, in case his direct male line should become
extinct. The clause which chiefly concerns us runs
as follows: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<em>Item est actum et in pactum solempni
stipulatione vallatum et expresse deductum quod in casu
quo præfatus dominus Johannes Galeas vicecomes, comes
Virtutum, dominus Mediolanensis, decedat sine filiis
masculis de suo proprio corpore ex legitimo matrimonio
procreatis, dicta domina Valentina, nata sua, succedat
et succedere debeat in solidum in toto dominio suo presente
et futuro quocumque, absque eo quod per viam
testamenti, codicillorum, seu alicujus alterius ultimæ
voluntatis, aut donatione inter vivos, ipsa aliquid faciat
seu facere possit in contrarium quovis modo.</em>”</span></p>

<p class='c006'>The husband of Valentine was for many years the
tool with which the astute Visconti hoped to assure
his own supremacy in Italy. In 1393 and in 1394
Visconti had no dearer scheme than that Clement, the
Antipope at Avignon, should make the Duke of Orleans
king of Adria. With Clement at Rome, Anjou at
Naples, Orleans ruling the centre from Spoleto to
Ferrara, Visconti beheld the annihilation of Venice
and the Tuscan republics—a united Italy north of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Rome. Doubtless he intended the kingdom of Adria
and the kingdom of Lombardy to lose themselves in
one monarchy: but whether that result was to be
attained by the subsequent spoliation of Orleans or by
his adoption as heir to Milan, was a question which
probably depended on the living or dying of the sons
of Giangaleazzo. Orleans, however, though so young,
proved himself no facile instrument. He had no intention
that Adria and Lombardy should unite to his
own disadvantage; and silently he contemplated
another scheme—to secure the docility of Lombardy
by bounding it on the south by Adria and on the north
by another French principality, to be formed by a
fusion of Asti and Genoa. Orleans, therefore, determined
to begin by the conquest of Genoa; and for
three years he displayed so much ability that Giangaleazzo
began to suspect this count of Asti and seigneur
of Savona, whom the Genoese implored to become
the governor of the Ligurian republic. Then came
the scandal of the acquisition of Genoa by Charles
VI., to the detriment of his brother. From 1395 to
1397 there is a moment of division between the
interests of Orleans and Visconti; but, as we shall
see, the last act of Visconti was to enforce the claims
of Orleans to Milan, and the Duke of Orleans in his
will<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c014'><sup>[51]</sup></a> expressly bequeaths to his eldest son <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<em>la comté
d’Ast et autres terres que j’ay et puis avoir au pays de
Lombardy et d’outre les monts</em>.”</span> As far as Orleans and
Visconti could decide, there is no doubt of the claim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>of Orleans to Milan. But it is more difficult to decide
by what right Giangaleazzo Visconti disposed of the
emperor’s fiefs of Milan; for although, when Visconti
signed his daughter’s marriage-contract, he was
simply the illegal despot of Milan, eight years later
the emperor made him duke and received tribute at
his hands. The lands which Visconti had gained by
succession, by fraud, and by conquest, which he had
ruled by force and national custom, were now indubitably
his by feudal right. But in order to acquire the
security of this legality, the Duke of Milan, in theory
at all events, had sacrificed a certain portion of his
independence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first investiture was granted him on Sept. 5,
1395. From this date he held his duchy of Milan as
an imperial fief. But as what manner of fief? And
which class of fiefs admits a woman to be her father’s
heir?</p>

<p class='c006'>These questions, seemingly simple, are in reality
difficult to answer, because feudal law was quite indefinitely
modified by provincial custom. It was
chiefly custom which decided if an hereditary fief
could be inherited by a woman in default of males.
Thus in France the provinces of Burgundy and Normandy
were strictly masculine fiefs; but Lorraine,
Guienne, and Artois descended to daughters in default
of sons; and the duchy of Brittany, the kingdoms of
Cyprus, Navarre, and Naples (a Papal fief), will occur
to every mind; while in Germany itself, in the stronghold
of feudalism, the duchy of Mecklenburg descended
to daughters on extinction of the masculine branch;
many fiefs in Swabia, Zutphen, Pomerania, and
Saxony, followed this example.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>In the North of Italy the distinction between
legitimacy and illegitimacy had become so trivial a
thing, that sons, born in or out of wedlock, were
generally forthcoming in sufficient numbers to distance
any feminine claim; and the Imperial investiture—save
in the case when it carried with it the Imperial
Vicariat—was rather a rose in the buttonhole of the
tyrant than a necessary legalization of a tyranny
stronger than the law. Yet the marquisate of Montferrat
was brought into the house of the Palæologi
through a feminine succession; and in 1387 Valentine
Visconti brought the country of Asti (no less than
Milan an Imperial fief) unquestioned to her husband,
and with only the Pope’s investiture. A century later
Caterina Sforza ruled in Pesaro. The custom in Italy,
then, though dubious, various, and full of irregularities
and confusions was, on the whole, the same as the
custom in Mecklenburg, Pomerania, Swabia, Hungary,
Brittany, Navarre, and other places: on extinction of
the male descent a woman might succeed. If her succession
were provided for by the terms of the investiture;
or, in other cases, unless she were deliberately
excluded.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c014'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>In the investiture of 1395 which made Giangaleazzo
duke of Milan there is no mention of Valentine,
but neither is there any direct mention of
the sons of Giangaleazzo. The duchy of Milan is
bestowed on him, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>sui heredes et successores</em></span>. Now this
term in Italy, where the Pandects were still the model
of civil law, might be held to include <em>all</em> the children
of the possessor; and, on failure of the male line, the
daughter would be entitled to put in her claim. I am
not aware how much was implied in Germany at this
date by the employment of this term; but probably
there also it was at least ambiguous, since, under the
Hohenstaufen emperors, Roman law had made a great
advance through Germany, and since, later on, it was
found necessary to formulate a special clause that the
use of the expression <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>sui heredes</em></span> should not be considered
sufficient to authorize females to claim succession
to a masculine fief.</p>

<p class='c006'>Any ambiguity was dispelled the following year.
There was then a possibility of war between France
and Milan, grievously estranged at that date by the
presence of the French in Genoa, and by the rumours
of witchcraft which defamed the reputation and endangered
the safety of Madame Valentine in France.
At this juncture Giangaleazzo, probably alarmed at
the terms of his daughter’s marriage-contract, procured
a second imperial investiture,<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c014'><sup>[54]</sup></a> distinctly limiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>the succession to male heirs. But this was not
the end. In 1396 news came to Paris of the battle of
Nicopolis, which necessitated an immediate <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>rapprochement</em></span>
with Milan; for Giangaleazzo Visconti, feared
and hated because of his friendship with the Turk,
was at this juncture the one necessary man, capable
of mediating between the French and the East.
Great court was paid to him, and he accepted the
French advances. Peace and amity being restored
between the two countries, on March 30, 1397, he
obtained a third and last investiture from Wenzel,<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c014'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
which restored the conditions of inheritance to
their original footing, and bestowed the duchy of
Milan on Giangaleazzo Visconti, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>descendentes et successores
sui</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This ambiguity of phrase may possibly have been
designed. The fact that the fief was a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>pm corr 189.17 Fahnlehn Fahnlehen></em></span>,
directly dependent on the emperor, and that (so far
as I can discover) no special Imperial privilege had
been granted to Madame Valentine, would in Germany
itself appear as strong evidence in favour of a solely
masculine succession as even the second investiture
could afford. But in Italy, by the custom of the
country and the authority of contract and testament,
the children of Valentine would be included among
the heirs and descendants of her father; and, in case
the whole race of his sons expired, the vague terms of
the investiture would allow the line of Orleans to put
in a claim which would prevent so important a part
of Italy from relapsing to the foreign emperor. Such
at least, as it appears to me, must have been the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>design of the duke in obtaining this last investiture,
a two-edged weapon in the hands of him who has been
described as the wisest and the most astute among all
the princes of the west.</p>

<p class='c006'>His position, therefore, seems to have been as
follows. To secure himself against any inconvenient
pretensions of the French, he had the restrictions of
the feudal law; and yet he was equally protected
against the encroachments of the empire. He had
the sanction of local custom, the ambiguity of the
terms of investiture; and, in addition to this, a papal
privilege, conceding to Valentine the right to succeed
her brothers or her nephews in the state of Milan.</p>

<p class='c006'>The right of a Pope to dispose of an Imperial fief
appears upon the face of it a very questionable
matter, even when the Empire be really vacant. When
Valentine Visconti was contracted to her husband,
Clement VII. had merely declared an interregnum
in the empire, on account of the adherence of Wenzel,
King of the Romans, to the faction of Urban the Pope
at Rome. Such was the supremacy of the Church
over Imperial affairs at this period, that, notwithstanding
the absurdity of this plea and the fact that
Clement was an Antipope, none was ever found to
question the legality of the French claim to Asti,
which was not granted to Orleans by any Imperial
privilege until the investiture of 1413. An intriguing
adventurer anxious to consolidate a new and unpopular
dynasty by every legal claim, Giangaleazzo
cultivated Emperor, Pope, and Antipope. Urban and
Clement and Wenzel were all in turn solicited to confirm
the tenure of Visconti. Corio appears to believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>that the succession of Valentine to Milan was granted
by Urban, who was certainly in Lombardy in the
year 1387. But Urban had denied to Giangaleazzo
the coveted title of king of Italy; and there are as
yet no documents discovered which prove the alluring
hypothesis that the astute Visconti held in his
possession a decree of the Pope no less than a decree
of the Antipope granting the succession to Milan
to his daughter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Enough, however, remains to show by what a cunning
opposition of France to Germany, and Germany
to France, the Duke of Milan strove to secure
Italian independence. If the Germans, then but the
shadow of a power, chose to assert their over-lordship,
the claim of the French was strong enough to
insure them two enemies instead of one; and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vice versa</em></span>:—as,
indeed, a later century too adequately proved.
Hoping to hold each neighbour in check and fear of
the other, Giangaleazzo meant to insure a period of
quiet growth for his own principality of Lombardy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the contract securing Milan to Valentine by a
papal transfer made for France; the second investiture
was absolute for Germany: the first and third
were so worded that they conveyed a different meaning
on either side of the Alps. Besides papal
privileges and imperial investitures there is, however,
a third way of conferring property: I mean the way
in which Naples was transferred to Anjou—the way
of bequest.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, the reader will exclaim, can a feoffer dispose
of a fief without the written consent of his feodary?
Here, as in the question of feminine succession, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>matter was chiefly decided by the custom of the province.
In certain countries—as, for example, Nassau,
Friedland, Ober Lausitz—a feoffer might dispose of
his possessions by will, although a contrary law held
good in other countries.</p>

<p class='c006'>But whatever the local law, the tendency was
strong, even in feudal Germany, to diminish the
rights of the empire to the advantage of the feudatory
powers. As Menzel puts it, “the emperor grasped but
a shadowy sceptre ... the princes increased in wealth
and power, while the emperor was gradually impoverished.
Imperial investiture had become a mere form,
which could not be refused except on certain occasions;
and the pfalzgraves, formerly intrusted with
the management of Imperial allods, had seized them
as hereditary fiefs.” What was done with impunity
in Germany, was done with audacity beyond the
Alps. And the Duke of Milan, who had received his
principality as a vassal, intended to dispose of it like
an hereditary monarch. If we impeach his right to
pursue this course, it is not only the claims of the
Visconti, but of almost every noble family in Italy,
Germany, or Flanders that must submit to be denied
or censured.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet claiming and acting upon his own authority to
dispose of Milan, Giangaleazzo Visconti involved his
testament in the same web of intrigue and counter-intrigue
which characterized his earlier policy. No
less than three wills, entirely different, are open to
us; and as the most important of these is only known
in an undated copy, it is difficult to decide which was
his final disposition of affairs. The first, familiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>enough to the student of Corio, was drawn up in
1397, and was modified in 1401; it makes no provision
at all for Valentine. The second (No. ccxxiii
in the first volume of Osio’s documents), undated, but
probably composed in 1397, confirms her <em>in all possessions
previously bestowed</em>, but grants her nothing else,
unless she should fall into a state of poverty or widowhood,
in which case she was to have sufficient and
princely nurture in her brother’s home at Milan, with
a dowry in case she should contract a second marriage.
This is all, yet this is enough to confirm the
contract of 1387. But it is the latest-found of the
testaments of Giangaleazzo Visconti which is most
important to the student of the French claim to Milan.
This will, discovered in 1872 by Signor Luigi Osio in
the Milanese Archives, gives an entirely new force to
the pretensions of Orleans. Yet it exists only in copy
and in extract—like a passage of Sappho saved by
some unconscious grammarian—quoted by a Sforzesco
advocate in a letter of warning addressed to Lodovico
il Moro on Jan. 10, 1496.</p>

<p class='c006'>At this date, the usurper Lodovico (possessed by
the family conviction that at some time his grandfather,
Filippo Maria Visconti, must have made a will
bequeathing Milan to Lodovico’s mother) had entrusted
his friend and kinsman Giason del Maino
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>elegantissimo et celeberrimo legista</em></span>, <a id='corr193.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='if we may'>(if we may</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_193.27'><ins class='correction' title='if we may'>(if we may</ins></a></span> trust the
verdict of Corio) with the task of searching the Milanese
Archives to this end. Del Maino discovered nothing
concerning Madonna Bianca; but instead he found
two highly compromising copies of the will of Giangaleazzo
Visconti, which had come to light in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>house of Messer Giovanni Domenico Oliari, notary of
Pavia, son of Andriano Oliari (an obstinate and
honest servant of the Visconti dukes), of whom my
readers will hear more upon a future page.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As for these copies,” wrote Messer Giasone, “though
they are only copies, and by no means according to
the terms, I entreat you to have them seized at once,
as well as three other copies which I have reason
to believe are in the possession (1) of the brothers of
the Certosa of Pavia, (2) of Manfredo da Ozino,
and (3) of the Signore della Mirandola. You will do
well to keep them safe, for they would be of the
greatest value to the Duke of Orleans, since this testament
and fidei-commissio provides that, should the
sons of Giangaleazzo die without male heirs, one of the
sons of Madonna Valentine shall succeed to Milan.
And, though I could find it in my heart to maintain that
the Duke of Orleans has no right to obtain anything,
as to Milan, from you or your illustrious children,
none the less you will do well to keep these copies
safe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lodovico took the hint. Of the five copies mentioned
not one exists to-day. Only the forgotten
letter remains to show the intention of Giangaleazzo
Visconti. Sudden death and swift oblivion rudely
damaged his dexterous intrigues—so much here for
France, so much there for Germany—an even balance
held neatly in a steady hand. The plague numbed
that cunning hand for ever in the autumn of 1402.
Murder soon removed the elder son of the great duke;
and the bastard Gabriello died on the executioner’s
scaffold in hostile Genoa. Both died childless, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Milan fell to their younger brother, Filippo Maria. He
ruled in peace and splendour for more than thirty years
in Milan. But two marriages brought him no sons;
only one daughter, and she illegitimate, cheered his
magnificent palace. As the Duke grew old, men
began to ask each other who should succeed him in
Milan: his natural daughter, married to the great
captain Francesco Sforza? or his nephew, his sister’s
son, the Duke of Orleans? or his wife’s relations of
Savoy? or, after all, must Milan return, a lapsed
fief, into the foreign hands of the German emperor.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>II.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Meanwhile a melancholy fate had pursued the
French heirs to Milan, the children of Valentine and
Orleans. This is not the place to explain how their
young dissensions with their father’s murderers summoned
the English into France; or how the youngest,
John of Angoulême, was sent to England, a mere
child, in 1412, as a hostage for his brother’s debt; or
how, three years later, the defeat at Agincourt sent
Charles of Orleans to join him there. The sons of
Valentine remained in prison all their youth. When,
in 1440, the son of their father’s murderer, the gentle
Duke of Burgundy, ransomed the Duke of Orleans out
of bondage, Charles was a man of forty-six,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c014'><sup>[55]</sup></a> who returned
home to find his estates half ruined by disastrous
wars; his brother Philip dead; his half-brother a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>hero—Dunois, the restorer of his country. It was
late to regain his position in this altered world, but
at least he lost no time. In the same month of the
same year (November, 1440) Charles married a niece
of Burgundy, Mary of Cleves. In 1445 his brother,
John of Angoulême, newly released from England,
married a neighbour of his sister’s—Marguerite de
Rohan, to whose elder sister he had been contracted
in his youth. The two princes were determined to
recover their inheritance, to raise up children, and
restore the ancient dignity of their house. Much of
Angoulême and much of Orleans and much of the
inheritance of Bonne d’Armagnac was still in the
hands of the English. The estates of Orleans in
France were grievously diminished. And outside
France Asti had been lost also.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the year 1422, when Charles of Orleans had lain
already seven years, and John ten years, in an English
prison, when Philip of Vertus was dead, when
France was paralysed, and Henry VI. of England
crowned the king of France in Paris, the county of
Asti, in great fear of the English (those Goths of the
Riviera) and of the nearer jealousies of ambitious
Montferrat, sent to Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of
Milan, and begged him to receive Asti under his
guardianship and protection<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c014'><sup>[57]</sup></a> until such time as
either of his nephews should be released from England.
The Duke of Milan consented willingly. Asti
was the Calais of Italy, and from the Italian point of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>view it appeared intolerable and unnatural that this
one county should remain a little island of France in
Lombardy, a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>pied-à-terre</em></span> across the mountains for
invading Gaul. And now, after twenty years of
undisturbed possession, the Duke of Milan turned a
deaf ear to his nephew’s reminder that he was home
again and ready to reassume his inheritance. As a
fact the Duke did not dare to restore Asti. In 1438
he had made Francesco Sforza his lieutenant there;
and he was afraid of Sforza. It was in vain sending
letters and requisitions; so in the beginning of the
year 1441 the princes of Orleans sent Dunois to
Milan.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c014'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>There were other matters more important even than
the restitution of Asti, upon which it was well that a
man so wise, so experienced, so persuasive as Dunois
should confer with the uncle of his half-brothers.
The Duke of Milan had no sons, one daughter only,
and she was illegitimate. Therefore the princes of
Orleans considered themselves the heirs to Milan. But
they were not alone in expecting this inheritance. The
Emperor pointed to the clause in the investiture of 1396
which declared that, in default of males, Milan should
revert to the empire. Jacopo Visconti, a distant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>cousin of the Duke’s, brought forward some pretensions
of his own. Sforza, the husband of the Duke’s
natural daughter, thought of the house of Este and
of other Italian houses where more than once a bastard,
if courageous and beautiful, had succeeded to his
father before legitimate heirs; and as to the fact that
Madonna Bianca was a woman, had not Giovanna I.
of Naples succeeded to King Robert, even in defiance
of a Salic law? Meanwhile the princes of Savoy
remembered that when the Duke of Milan had married
the Savoyard princess he had made, upon receipt
of her dower, a promise to her father and her brother
that if no children sprang from this union, he would
bequeath the titles of Milan to Savoy. It is significant
of the strange confusion of the laws of inheritance
in Italy that all these princes believed in the right of
a Duke of Milan to bestow by testament, or deed or
gift, or marriage-contract, that which was, in fact, a
fief of the Holy Roman Empire. But the rights of
the empire had fallen into long disuse across the Alps,
where a strange confusion of kinship, bequest, investiture,
or election by the people regulated the succession
to Papal and Imperial fiefs. Some princes
succeeded in one way, some in the other. To the
eyes of contemporaries they all appeared justifiable
alternatives, giving some shadow of right to that
which a strong hand meant to grasp and meant to
keep. “Most of the princes in Italy,” wrote Commines
fifty years later, “hold their lands by no title unless
it be given them in heaven, which we can but
divine.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus eyed suspiciously by rival heirs, Dunois, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>the representative of Orleans, crossed the Alps in
1441 and came to Milan, both to require the restitution
of Asti, and also, as Ventura remarks, to confer
on other matters with the Duke. The Duke of Milan
was a sad, timid, indifferent man, old at five-and-fifty
and harassed by an almost lunatic suspicion of danger
from his friends. As he grew older his fears and
doubts grew stronger, and he saw no motive for any
sort of conduct beside the desire to succeed him in
Milan. Oppressed by hypochondria, corpulent to
deformity, fatigued by the weight of his body, and
exhausted by the heaviness upon his spirits, this
timid and sceptical Volpone of Lombardy found his
sole amusement in weaving into a complicated perplexity
the expectations of his heirs. Sitting immovable
in his corner at Milan, like some huge spider
spinning in the dusk, he crossed and recrossed,
twisted and confused, in his dreary web, the hopes
of Sforza and of Orleans, of Savoy and of the bastard
cousins of his house.</p>

<p class='c006'>No one could be sure of the succession. Sforza, the
object of his senile fondness, was the object also of
his insane suspicion. The Duke had tried a score of
times to shuffle out of a promise to give him his
natural daughter; and the very week that he had
finally consented to their marriage, he sent a private
messenger to Lionello d’Este, offering <em>him</em> the hand
of Madonna Bianca. Nevertheless, in 1441 Sforza
married Bianca, a mere girl, but bringing in her
dowry the Signories of Cremona and Pontremoli, in
addition to his lieutenancy of Asti. After the marriage
he was no more sure of the Duke of Milan than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>he had been before. The uncertain seesaw of the
Duke’s caprices continued as unsteady as of old. On
the one hand, the Duke was aware that Sforza, though
the son of a peasant, was the most remarkable Italian
of his day, courageous, frank, spirited, kind of heart,
and cunning. His immense strength of will both
attracted and repelled the vacillating and suspicious
Visconti. He admired Sforza, and Sforza was the husband
of his only child. Still more, Sforza was secretly
supported by Agnese del Maino, the mother of Bianca,
the sole woman whose influence had ever touched the
indifferent and preoccupied heart of Filippo Maria.
On the other hand, the Duke was afraid of <a id='corr200.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Sforzo'>Sforza</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_200.13'><ins class='correction' title='Sforzo'>Sforza</ins></a></span>—and
to fear, in timid natures, is to hate.</p>

<p class='c006'>When fear and suspicion sank the scale, Visconti
inclined to his wife’s relations of Savoy, who, having
no right at all except such as he chose to give them,
presented no cause for fear. Or he encouraged the
claims of Jacopo Visconti. Osio, in a note, informs
us that this Jacopo Visconti was the son of Gabriello,
the bastard of Giangaleazzo, and had this been the
case Jacopo Visconti would have had a certain claim.
But Gabriello left no children, and Jacopo must have
been the son of one of the numerous children of
Bernabò. Nevertheless he considered himself to have
pretensions. When all these had been weighed in the
balance and found wanting, there remained the
princes of Orleans.</p>

<p class='c006'>In early life the Duke of Milan had been inclined
to France; and he had been a suitor for that Princess
Marie d’Anjou, who afterwards married King Charles
VII. From 1420 to 1427 the pages of Osio abound in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>messages and treaties. Then the vexed question of
Asti began to embitter his relations with France, and
to increase that fatal suspicion which ever made him
turn with sudden loathing from his former friends.
While his discontent with Anjou was still undecided,
the Genoese handed into his custody the enemy of
Anjou, the prince of Arragon, taken prisoner at sea.
In their suzerain Visconti, the ally of Anjou, the
Genoese imagined that they had found a sure custodian
for Arragon. But they had not reckoned upon
the personal charm of Alfonso the Magnanimous, nor
upon the capricious indifference of Visconti. Young,
handsome, engaging, fearless, their chivalrous captive
won the heart of his timid jailer, and easily turned
his fluctuating policy from Anjou towards Arragon.
Visconti suddenly deserted his own subjects, released
Alfonso without consulting the Genoese, and supported
him upon the throne of Naples.</p>

<p class='c006'>With some thought in his heart, doubtless, of the
success of Alfonso, Dunois turned his steps to Milan.
He also was handsome, persuasive, rhetorical; and if
no longer young, his comely head was encircled by
the aureole of heroic victory. But Dunois lacked the
enthusiasm, the spontaneity, that, in Arragon, had
warmed for a moment the numb and chilly heart of
the Duke of Milan. Dunois was as cold, as sceptical,
as wise, as worldly as himself. His flowers of speech
made no real effect upon the weary Duke, who, to get
rid of him, made, doubtless, some magnificent promise
for the future; for Dunois did not insist on his
demand for Asti, but returned almost immediately to
France, hoping to settle matters by the friendly intervention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>of the Emperor Frederic; but at that time
the customary <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>malentendu</em></span> as to the occupation of
Alsace estranged France and Germany, and Frederic
declined to interfere with the projects of the Duke of
Milan.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dunois had not impressed the Duke, who was impressed
only by youth, fearlessness, and a never-daunted
will. He thought he perceived these
qualities in the young Dauphin, half in disgrace on
his estate in Dauphiné. Him also Visconti determined
to drag into the tangled web of the Milanese
succession; and about this time negotiations with
the Dauphin Louis began to complicate the difficulties
of Transalpine policy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Already in the spring of 1445<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c014'><sup>[58]</sup></a> a minute in the
Archives of Milan, transcribed by Signor Luigi Osio,
records the willingness of the Duke of Milan to further
the Dauphin in his plan of an Italian invasion, provided
that Louis agree to help the friends and not the
enemies of Visconti. Asti should be confided to a
person equally trusted by Orleans and Milan, and after
the expiration of a given term should be freely handed
back to the eldest son of Valentine. Notwithstanding
this fair-spoken scheme, Visconti finds it necessary to
caution his young ally against certain persons on the
French side of the Alps who use threats and menaces
towards the Crown of Milan. By these it is clear that
he intends his nephews of Orleans. He has no
friendship for them. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Noluit restituere</em></span>, briefly remarks
Secundino Ventura.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The negotiations with Louis proceeded briskly, and
in May the Milanese ambassador arrived in Paris,
where he found <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>grande garra e divisione</em></span> between the
restless Dauphin and King René of Sicily, who he
remarks (to our unfeigned surprise) <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>è quello che governa
tucto questo reame</em></span>. Meanwhile Louis, young as he
was, had already learned a maxim as true in policy
as in almsgiving: he let not his right hand divine
the secrets of his left; and while on the one side he
treated with the Duke of Milan, on the other he
practised with Savoy. According to the latter plan
Savoy and the Dauphin, aided by Montferrat and
Mantua and Ferrara, were to conquer between them
the north of Italy; France was to take Genoa, the
Lucchese, Parma, Piacenza, Tortona—all south of
the Po and east of Montferrat; Savoy was to gain
Milan and keep the Riviera; Alessandria was to be
handed over to Montferrat, and the Duke of Ferrara
and the Marquis of Mantua were, <em>for the present</em>, to
keep their actual possessions; but this significant
phrase was followed by one more significant still: “All
future conquests are to be divided at the rate of two
shares to France and one share to Savoy.”<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c014'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>An intimate acquaintance with documents inspires
little confidence in the rectitude of human nature.
Of all these personages, Charles of Orleans, a simple
lyric creature, kept fresh and wholesome in arrested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>youth behind his prison bars, and Sforza, an honest,
grasping and ambitious soldier, alone inspire respect
or sympathy. This old duke, conscious that in a few
months his immense possessions will have dwindled
to a single grave, amusing the last hours of his
sceptical, indifferent existence by juggling the expectations
of a dozen heirs; this child-prince, without
an impulse or an illusion left of youth, successfully
deceiving a couple of enemies who each believes himself
his sole ally—these unfortunately are no exceptions
to the rule of the game.</p>

<p class='c006'>Savoy, in the act of drawing up this project of conquest,
was encouraging the Milanese to trust him
to secure them a free republic on the death of the
Duke. Montferrat and Mantua, pledged on the one
hand to conquer Italy with the Dauphin, were as
deeply pledged to Venice<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c014'><sup>[60]</sup></a> to oppose the invader and
preserve the peace. Each had been careful to risk
something on every possible event, so that no sudden
turn of the wheel of Fortune could bring about complete
disaster.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 9th of February, 1447, an indiscreet French
squire, riding to Rome upon a message, let out to the
Florentines that a league had been formed between
the Dauphin of France and the Duke of Milan.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c014'><sup>[61]</sup></a>
According to this report Visconti had offered to aid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>the lad to recover Genoa, and had volunteered, in
defiance of the rights of Orleans, to make him lord of
Asti. A document in Osio (t. iii. ccclxxiii.) dated the
20th of December, 1446, and a series of letters in the
Bibliothèque Nationale,<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c014'><sup>[62]</sup></a> confirm this remarkable
statement, which, if it spread horror throughout Italy,
caused no less indignation among the heirs of Valentine.
Strangely enough it was Sforza, at that time
the Milanese governor of Asti, who advocated the
cause of the Dauphin. “Give him Asti, and he will
do you excellent service. Pay him well; and yet
contrive it in such a way that none but your Highness
shall be cock or hen in this country.” This advice
was rendered still more unpalatable to the Italians
and to the house of Orleans by a rumour that the
Duke of Milan intended to adopt the Dauphin as his
heir. Before the month was out the north Italian
princes formed themselves into a counter-league
against France and Milan, and Orleans and Dunois
had despatched to Milan the baillie of Sens, a certain
Reynouard du Dresnay, with a demand for the immediate
restitution of Asti. This time they would
brook no refusal, they would be tempted by no future
benefits. Indignant and disenchanted, they instructed
their lieutenant to press the matter home; and on
the 4th of May, Asti again returned to France. The
conditions of the surrender were peculiar. The
county was not directly given back to Orleans, but
yielded to Du Dresnay as the lieutenant of the king,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>so long as the said king should preserve the good will
and consent of Charles of Orleans, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>directus dominus
ipsius civitatis et patriæ</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this matter at least the shifty Duke of Milan was
outwitted. Asti had slipped from his grasp; France had
again her hand upon the key of Lombardy. Much of
his interest in the game was gone. As the summer
waxed and waned, the Duke grew more than ever
heavy, indifferent, and lethargic. He was not seriously
ill, but, as I have said, his interest in the game was
over. In August his health, always feeble, sank in the
great heat of the summer. Immense in his unwieldly
corpulence, the Duke sat in a darkened chamber of his
palace brooding over his unfinished testament. He
suffered no physician near him, and his illness—a low
fever—was kept a secret. But the faint heart of
Filippo Maria could no longer animate the weight of
his body. On the 13th of August, 1447, he died—less
of his illness, it was said, than of utter indifference,
as one who, weary of the spectacle of existence, left
his seat and retired whence he came.</p>

<p class='c006'>Above the corpse, scarcely yet cold, the rival heirs,
in eager expectation, gathered to the reading of the
will. The Duchess-dowager represented Savoy;
Madonna Bianca appeared for the absent Sforza;
Raynouard du Dresnay came to Milan on behalf of
Orleans; while, at a distance, Montferrat and Jacopo
Visconti looked to their own interests; the Venetians
had hopes of their own; the Milanese, as we know,
intended to inaugurate a republic; the emperor,
serene above these petty quarrels, declared that by
feudal law Milan had already devolved to him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Absent or present, there was not one of these, save
him, but had some promise of Filippo Maria’s in his
mind when at length the testament was opened. The
will was dated August 12th,<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c014'><sup>[63]</sup></a> the day before the
death of the Duke. There was no mention in it of
his daughter, Madonna Bianca, none of his wife,
none of any of his nephews or kinsmen. He left
Alfonso of Arragon his universal heir.</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps, as Guicciardini suggests, love of his people
induced the dying Duke to leave his city to a distant
tyrant; perhaps, in his suspicion of his present
friends, his fancy turned with pleasure to the good
bright youth who had been his captive long ago; perhaps
his defeat at Asti made him like to think of the
evil turn that once he had done the French in Naples;
or, it may be, the mere desire of outraging the detestable
<em>cohue</em> of his quasi-legal heirs proved <a id='corr207.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='irrestibly'>irresistibly</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_207.16'><ins class='correction' title='irrestibly'>irresistibly</ins></a></span>
fascinating to the sceptical old man. At least so it
was. Every right was outraged;<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c014'><sup>[64]</sup></a> the King of Naples
was left the Duke of Milan. “Nevertheless come here
as soon as you can,” wrote Antonio Guidoboni to
Sforza<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c014'><sup>[65]</sup></a> on the 14th; “once on the spot and half the
game is won.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>III.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It was at this moment that for the first time the
French claim to Milan became a question for practical
politics. Frederic the Pacific was not the man to
press the rights of the German Empire in Italy, rights
which at this time were continually disregarded, and
which nothing less than a military occupation could
enforce. Even the Ghibellines in Lombardy declared,
not for the Emperor Frederic, but for Count Francesco
Sforza. Yet the Emperor Frederic was, so far as the
legal and abstract side of the matter was concerned,
the one really serious rival of the Duke of Orleans.</p>

<p class='c006'>For Alfonzo of Arragon showed no inclination to
take up arms in defence of his unexpected bequest.
Although, in the city of Milan itself, he had a considerable
party in his favour, at this time neither
Alfonso nor his rivals appear to have regarded the
will of the late duke in any serious spirit. The story
ran in Milan that, in the week before his death, when
that astounding testament was made, Filippo Maria
had smiled and said, “It will be good to see how it
will go to pieces when I am dead.” A cynical pleasure
in aggravating as much as possible this imminent
ruin must, I think, have prompted the Duke to leave
Milan to Alfonso. And if his detached, amused,
malevolent soul could really from any extra-mundane
point of vantage have watched the events which
quickly followed his decease, he would have found the
spectacle as exciting and as novel as he wished. The
Milanese at once declared themselves a free republic,
governed by various Princes of Liberty. Whereupon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>all the subject cities announced that if Milan was a
republic, so was each of them, for they would not
submit to bear the yoke of a city no nobler than the
rest. Hereupon such of the cities as were not strong
enough to stand alone gave themselves, some to the
Venetians, some to Savoy, some to Genoa, some to
Orleans, some to Montferrat, some to Ferrara; and
all these powers sent armies into Lombardy to protect
their rights. Matters were still further complicated
by the dissensions of the Bracceschi and Sforzeschi,
the Guelfs and Ghibellines. In Pavia alone, for instance,
the Guelfs declared, some for Venice, some for
Orleans, some for the King of France, some for the
Dauphin; the Bracceschi declared for Alfonzo of
Arragon; Savoy and Montferrat each had a faction
at their service, but the great body of the Ghibellines
were in favour of Count Francesco Sforza, to whom
finally the city submitted. This was a blow to the
free republic of Milan next door; but in the miserable
state of their dominions, the unfortunate Princes
of Liberty did not dare to remonstrate with their too
potent commander, and Count Francesco, sovereign
at Pavia, continued to be the servant of the Milanese
republic.</p>

<p class='c006'>So soon as the news of the death of the Duke of
Milan came to France, the French prepared to assert
the rights of Orleans. On September 3rd Charles
VII. wrote from Bourges to Turin, recommending the
rights of Orleans to Savoy:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Nostre tres-cher et très-amé frère, le Duc d’Orléans,
à présent Duc de Milan</em></span> [asserts the king] <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>par le décès
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>du feu Duc son oncle, qui est naguères allé de vie à
trespas, comme son plus prochain hoir, nous a bien exprès
faict dire et remonstré le bon droict qu’il ha au dict
Duché de Milan.</em></span>”<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c014'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>And Savoy, in all his further proceedings to obtain
the protectorate of Milan for himself, excepts the
French claim, against which he avows himself powerless
to protest. This claim, theoretically so strong,
had also in its favour the devotion—the veneration,
says Corio—which the royal name of France inspired
in the Guelfs of Lombardy; and in this moment of
revolution the Guelfs, the democratic party, were
exceptionally powerful. The governor of Asti, Raynouard
du Dresnay, infected by the ardour of the
times, could no longer await the coming of his
master, but on September 22nd, furnished with 3,300
golden ducats of Asti, at the head of a little force
of 1,500 men-at-arms, sallied out to plant the royal
lilies of Orleans upon the soil of Milan.</p>

<p class='c006'>Almost at once the inhabitants of Felizzano, Solero,
Castellaccio, and Bergolio yielded to his arms. So
many of the fortresses in the Alessandrino followed
suit that Alessandria and all the country round were
filled with fear. The force of Raynouard was very
small, but inspired with so much fury, such fervour
and cruelty of battle, that the softer Italians did not
dare resist him. The smaller cities opened at his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>knock, and even in the larger cities there was a party
which, afraid of his vengeance, and fascinated by the
prestige of France, would have welcomed him with
open arms. Yet there were many, hating the stranger
and his barbarian ferocity, who sent messenger after
messenger to Sforza, bidding him arrive and deliver
them. “Patience!” said Count Francesco. “In the
first onslaught the French are more than men. Soon
they will weary, and then we will attack them.” But
meanwhile, with undiminished energy, day after day
the victories of Raynouard proceeded, and further
and further into Lombardy advanced the banners of
the king of France.</p>

<p class='c006'>On October 1st an embassy from the unhappy republic
of Milan arrived in Venice requesting aid and
counsel. This, of a truth, was seeking sweetness in
the jaws of the lion; for Lodi, Codogno, and other
cities had already revolted to the Venetians, who
hoped in time, by skilful management, to possess
the greater part of Lombardy. But the bewildered
Princes of Liberty knew not in whom to place their
trust. Venice and Florence were leagued together,
and each hoped to obtain something from the dismemberment
of the territories of Milan; Montferrat,
Mantua, Savoy, Genoa, and France, in open arms, were
spoliating the corpse of their neighbour—for a corpse
indeed it seemed—and of the captain-general of their
own forces these heads of the republic were more profoundly
suspicious than of any open foe. Too many
of the nobles in Milan were secretly in favour of this
adventurer. Only the people, the Guelfs, sustained
their republican ardour with violent rhetoric, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>declared that they would rather be the servants of
the Turk, or of the Devil, than of Count Francesco
Sforza.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was this in favour of Venice, that she detested
Count Francesco (who had left her service
for the Duke of Milan’s) as bitterly as any Guelf
in Lombardy. And Venice, the most aristocratic
of oligarchies, was for complicated political reasons
greatly favoured by the Guelfs. Therefore, not without
hope in their hearts, the delegates of Milan
awaited the answer of the Venetian senate. Three
practicators, or agents, were deputed by the Ten to
confer with the ambassadors concerning the proposed
alliance between Milan and Venice; but these agents
were secretly bidden in no way to commit or bind the
Venetian government (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>nichil obligando nos</em></span>); for the
conference really was to be only a means of extracting
information as to the true condition of affairs in
Milan.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c014'><sup>[67]</sup></a> And it would be as valueless to us, as to the
hapless, bamboozled Milanese, were it not that here
we get, I think, the first evidence of the Venetian inclination
to pronounce for France.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c014'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>There was no help here from the violence of Raynouard.
Venice especially declared that against
France and Genoa she would do nothing. And every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>day recorded the conquests of the French. The
Milanese ambassadors returned very sadly, “despised
by the Venetians,” says Corio, “and treated as perniciously
as possible.” In vain they bade Francesco
Sforza give battle to the audacious little force of
Raynouard. Count Francesco, who had ever been
favourable to France, pursued his waiting game,
although Bosco Marengo, closely besieged by the
French, was almost at the end of possible resistance,
and the fall of Bosco meant the loss of Alessandria.
At last the Milanese succeeded in scraping together
about fifteen hundred soldiers, and these, under Coglioni,
they sent to Alessandria to harass the enemy.
The French were taken between two fires—on the one
side Coglioni, on the other the Alessandrian reinforcements;
yet at first they gained the day, but so furious
was their anger, and so long they dallied in the
slaughter of their enemies, that before they had
despatched the last, a further reinforcement of the
Milanese, and a successful sally on the part of the
besieged, intercepted their return. Raynouard was
taken prisoner with many of his men; the cities
which had revolted to him returned to the allegiance
of the Milanese republic; and the royal troops, leaderless
and disbanded in the very hour of victory, fled
home as best they might to Asti.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was on Oct. 17, 1447. Twelve days later the
Duke of Orleans himself arrived in Asti. There he
made a solemn entry on Oct. 26th, riding under a däis
borne by the notables of the city robed and hooded
all in white, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>pro majori letitia adventus ipsius domini
ducis</em></span>. Charles of Orleans was now a man of fifty-seven,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>amiable and sanguine. Something of the
charm and of the inefficiency of youth appeared to
linger around this aging poet, who, taken captive a
youth of twenty-four, issued into the world again
almost a man of fifty. Those intervening years had
held for him none of the serious business of life: and
his experience was still the experience of charming,
ardent, and unhappy youth. Since Agincourt he had
counted his years by lyrics, not by battles; and now
perhaps one of the serious things to him in this contentious
Lombardy was his friendship with Antonio
Astesano, professor of eloquence and poetry at Asti,
himself no inconsiderable versifier, and author of
a poetic epistle on the victories of the Maid
of Orleans, which in 1430 he had sent to the Duke
in his English prison. Charles, with his serene
unpractical temper, his interest in literature, his inexperience
of life, hoping all things, doing nothing,
appears a strange figure in that distracted Lombardy:
a garlanded maypole stuck in the front of
battle.</p>

<p class='c006'>At first the arrival of the Duke of Orleans appeared
an event of immeasurable importance. The Guelfs in
every Lombard town, who at first had thought only
of Venice, began, more loudly even than during the
campaign of Raynouard, to declare for France. The
Duke came armed with promises from France, from
Burgundy, from Brittany, from England. There
were no bounds to the magnificence with which he
declared himself about to take the field. But perhaps
it would not be necessary to take the field at all. The
Duke sent a deputation to the Milanese republic; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>lord of Cognac, one of the nobles of Ceva, Caretti
(whose family all the while were practising none too
secretly with Montferrat), Secondino Natti, Antonio
Romagnano, and Francesco Roero, requested the
Milanese to submit to the allegiance of their lawful
duke. But the Milanese were all too well aware of
the hateful consequences of tyranny. Men were still
alive whose brothers and whose children had been
torn to pieces, limb by limb, by the hounds of Giammaria
Visconti, the uncle of this man. The suspicion,
the cunning, the timid fear of Filippo Maria had succeeded
to that oppression. “This time,” said the
people of Milan, “we will preserve ourselves a free
republic.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A show of force would at least be necessary to
induce them to change their minds; and in December,
1447, Charles of Orleans sent an embassy to Venice,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c014'><sup>[69]</sup></a>
requesting the Council to enter into an arrangement
with him, and to furnish him with troops. He
repeated his assurances of aid from France, England,
and Burgundy; and if such aid as this were really
forthcoming, Venice, animated by a limited Venetian
and not by a national Italian patriotism, would
certainly hesitate to cross his path. So bitter was the
hatred of Venice towards Sforza, that any other
candidate appeared preferable to him; and this douce,
unready Charles would be easier to manage than a
man of that heroic and ambitious type. Yet in a
matter so important it was, before all things, necessary
to be circumspect; and the Venetians put off the
Duke of Orleans with many assurances of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>devoted adherence and affection, many warnings
against the cunning and the machinations of Sforza,
while they wrote to their allies of Florence requesting
an opinion. At this instant Sforza was so dreaded in
Italy, and his victory appeared so imminent, that if a
few of the promised battalions had appeared in Piedmont
the Venetians would gladly have espoused the
cause of Orleans. But Sforza, left almost without
money, with no ally that he was really sure of except
his valiant wife, found the situation untenable. He
had not a friend in Italy, nor a friend across the
mountains. Peace, if only the feint of peace, was
imperative while he collected his unvanquished forces
for a further struggle. Early in January he wrote to
Florence, proposing peace. The Florentines and the
Venetians were bound in so close a league that peace
with the one meant truce with the other; and though,
at least twice, in solemn terms, the Council of Ten
warned the Florentine Signory that there was no substance
in this matter, for peace was contrary to the
real interests of Count Francesco, yet in the end
Venice agreed to accept this peace for what it was
worth, using the hour of respite to further her stratagems
in other quarters.</p>

<p class='c006'>The peace was not worth much. On May 9th
Andriano Ricci of Asti arrived in Venice with a
message from the Duke of Orleans.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c014'><sup>[70]</sup></a> “The French
reinforcements will soon be here,” said the sanguine
Duke; “will you also be my auxiliary?” The Venetians,
though still cautious, replied in terms of
alacrity—</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“We are ready to grant you all possible aid and
favour, and there is no other prince on earth whom we
so warmly desire to be our neighbour in Milan.
Hasten the King of France, for if any good effect is to
follow our endeavours, the troops should come at
once. And rely upon it, so soon as your French
auxiliaries are in readiness, we also will provide a
satisfactory contingent to help in the conquest of
Milan. And we are the readier to do this, since the
peace which we had begun to treat with the Milanese
republic is already broken, and we at this moment
are in open war with Milan.”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c006'>But, just at the instant when it would have given
most pleasure to Venice to support the claims of
Orleans, she began to feel grave doubts as to the
solidity of his pretensions. Those promised armies of
France, England, Burgundy, and Brittany, which had
been on the road ever since last December, would they
never cross the Alps? As yet not a single soldier had
appeared. How far could Venice trust the assertions
of the fanciful and sanguine Orleans? A strain in
him of the Visconti shiftiness mingled with the
rhetoric of his father, and for all his amiable simplicity
Charles of Orleans was not a man to inspire conviction.
The Venetians were, however, aware that
Burgundy was really in his favour. It was Burgundy
who had paid the ransom of Orleans, and Burgundy
had twice sent his ambassadors to Venice, entreating
the Ten in favour of his cousin. There was a great
friendship between the good Duke Philip and the
gentle Duke Charles; it seemed as if, having overcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>the tremendous barrier of an hereditary vendetta,
these two men, whose fathers had each been
murdered to satisfy the feud, entertained for each
other an affection that had gained by the obstacles it
had surmounted. If Burgundy, the richest duke in
Europe, supported Orleans, it might be well to aid
him even in the absence of France, England, and
Brittany. But it would be disastrous to support the
inefficient duke alone against such mighty odds. Yet
some aid against Sforza was immediately desirable.
To the Venetians, to have two strings to your bow
was the first axiom of policy; and on May 20, 1448,
the Ten despatched to Asti a secret messenger, one
Messer Bernardo Neri, who was to interview the Duke,<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c014'><sup>[71]</sup></a>
to obtain all possible information as to his army and
his auxiliaries, and then, in the utmost privacy, to
proceed to Savoy in order to judge in which direction
it best would suit the Venetian cat to jump.</p>

<p class='c006'>Messer Bernardo stayed over a fortnight at Asti,
although his commission was only for five days; and
from this we may suppose that at first he really had
expectations of the success of Orleans. But on
June 10th<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c014'><sup>[72]</sup></a> he left, ostensibly to return to Venice in
order to receive the answer of the Senate; but in
reality he went only a little way on the Venetian road
and turned aside at once into Savoy, for at Turin he
knew he should find further instructions from the
Senate. He could only spend a day or two over his
negotiations with the Duke there, for he had to return
to Asti on the day when an answer might reasonably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>be expected to reach that place from Venice. But
his interview with Duke Louis was evidently satisfactory,
for it is the first of a long series of negotiations.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile Orleans in Asti found his affairs did not
progress at all. The Venetians, though so prodigal
of offers of assistance, declined to come forward until
he had an army at his back. The Milanese refused to
recognize him. Worst of all, the French appeared to
have forgotten him. It seemed best to return to
France and collect his forces. So on Aug. 10th, after
a stay of nine months in Asti, Charles of Orleans
with all his household went home again across the
mountains. The Duke took back with him his friend
Antonio Astesano, and ever afterwards he retained a
strong affection for the country of his mother. The
visit of Charles of Orleans to Asti was important as
an introduction of Italian fashions, Italian architecture,
Italian arms, jewels,<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c014'><sup>[73]</sup></a> and vestments into
France. It caused a pure whiff of Italy to breathe
across the Gothic style of Charles VII. But it made
little or no effect on the furthering of the French
claim to Milan.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orleans had scarcely crossed the Alps before he was
as completely disregarded as though he had never
seemed the most dangerous pretender to the throne of
Milan. Savoy had taken his place. The claim of
Savoy was quite childish and ridiculous. He pretended
that, on the payment of his sister’s dowry to
the late Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria had promised
to leave his duchy, in default of sons, to the Duke of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Savoy.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c014'><sup>[74]</sup></a> It was evident that the Duke had done
nothing of the sort; he had left his throne to
Arragon. Besides, it is difficult to see how his testament
could dispose of property which, by his father’s
will and his sister’s marriage contract, was entailed
on his nephews of Orleans, and which, by feudal law,
must return to the Holy Roman Empire. But, however
shadowy his claims, the Duke of Savoy was a
great person to the Milanese. He was loved by them
and he was feared by them; and had he hazarded a
bold stroke instead of counteracting his own efforts by
a perfect maze of petty intrigues, he might easily
have made himself, if not the Duke of Milan, at any
rate protector of the Milanese republic.</p>

<p class='c006'>But Duke Louis was afraid to hazard all his chances
on any single throw. In 1446 he had intrigued with
the Dauphin to divide the Milanese with France; on
the 3rd of May, 1448, he drew up a secret and solemn
contract with the Milanese to protect their republic,
in consequence of which, a few months later, the
grateful city privately elected him her chief. In June,
1449, he was arranging with the King of Arragon to
conquer the estates of Milan with this ally, and
divide them at the rate of three-fifths for Arragon and
two-fifths for Savoy;<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c014'><sup>[75]</sup></a> and in the autumn of the same
year he was making a very similar proposal to the
Venetians. In the pains he took to win something,
however little, Savoy effectually safeguarded himself
from winning all. Yet at one time he appeared to
have great chances in his favour.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>In the summer and early autumn of 1448, both
Venice and the Milanese believed that a republic
under the joint protection of Venice and Savoy might
flourish in Milan, were it not for the undying energy
and resolution of Count Francesco <a id='corr221.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Sforzo'>Sforza</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_221.5'><ins class='correction' title='Sforzo'>Sforza</ins></a></span>. To be rid
of this man was to be rid of war; and twice in
August and once in September the Ten wrote to a
certain Lorenzo Minio, captain of the Brescia, that
they accept a certain proposal he had made: “If the
person he suggests will in truth deal death to Count
Francesco we shall be his debtors.”<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c014'><sup>[76]</sup></a> According to the
discretion of Minio they offered his candidate from
ten thousand to twenty thousand ducats; or, should
he be of the sort that stoops not to money, he should
have the captaincy of a regiment, of from two hundred
to four hundred lances. “But,” they proceeded,
“let not the matter stick for a trifle—cheer him and
inspirit him so that his resolution come to a good
effect, and that speedily; put him in heart with his
work and let it be done well.” The plain English of
these phrases means that the Venetian Council was
willing to pay a great sum of money to any one who
would undertake to poison Count Francesco Sforza.</p>

<p class='c006'>But before the proposal was carried out, a second
message, five months later, bade the friend of Minio
stay the destruction in his hand. “Count Francesco
having entered into good and faithful relations with
the Senate, we withdraw the order for his death.” As
suddenly as before and for as short a time an alliance
was declared between the Venetians and the
Milanese.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>This alliance, as before, was merely an occasion for
the resumption of intrigues. Arragon and Savoy,
Savoy and Venice, Venice and Milan were secretly
determining an arrangement which should exclude
Francesco Sforza. It seems scarcely worth while to
have countermanded the order for his death, since by
some means or another to be rid of this adventurer
was the aim and end of all this policy. The Guelfs of
Milan sent to Venice a certain Arrigo Panigarola, who
throwing himself upon his knees before the Ten, with
tears and prayers implored the Venetians to defend
his hapless city from Count Francesco. The Council
was impressed, but decided to reserve its answer for
a little while.</p>

<p class='c006'>A few months after the arrival of Panigarola, the
Duke of Savoy sent an ambassador to Venice upon a
similar errand. How was it possible that the Venetians,
so respectable a state, could support a wearisome
adventurer like Count Francesco? Savoy gave
the Venetians to understand that if they continued to
supply soldiers to the camp of Sforza he should
reckon his behaviour on their part a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>casus belli</em></span>. How
much better it would be if the Venetians would
acquiesce in an honourable peace between the Milanese
republic and Savoy and Venice! This threefold
league would effectually crush Francesco Sforza, and
would establish plenty and security in devastated
Lombardy; whereas if the present dissensions continue,
both Orleans and Arragon would certainly come
across the mountains to seek their profit here, and so
should a great fire be lit in Italy which much effusion
of blood would never quench. The Savoyard ambassador
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>waxed really eloquent over the blessings of
peace; for at this very time his master was writing
to his father the Antipope at Lucerne: “The Milanese
have secretly elected me chief, but what am I to do
with Italy for Sforza, Germany for the emperor, and
France for Orleans?” All indeed that he could do
was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>faire entretenir les Milanais par tous moyens, sans
avoir dict encore ne</em> non, <em>ne</em> ouy; <em>et, d’aultre part, envoyer
à Venise, et aussi envers le Comte François, et
aultres où il est nécessaire practicquer quelque bons moyens
par voye d’accord</em></span>.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c014'><sup>[77]</sup></a> Of all these various plots the
most successful for Savoy would have been a peace
strong enough to set at naught Francesco Sforza, to
restore prosperity to Lombardy, and to enable the
Milanese to elect him, with apparent spontaneity,
protector of their state. The first step was to secure
peace with Venice; and he found the Venetians in an
acquiescent mood. The important city of Crema had
followed the lead of Lodi and Codogno, and had
declared itself the subject of Saint Mark; and the
Venetians, who could not keep Crema and continue to
ally of Count Francesco, suddenly came to terms
with Panigarola, declared themselves the champions
of the Milanese republic, and offered the Duke of
Savoy not merely a friendly neutrality but an offensive
alliance.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c014'><sup>[78]</sup></a> They resumed their negotiations for
the assassination of Count Francesco, and, “without a
thought,” says Corio, “of the league or law divine,”
despatched him a message informing him that they,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>his comrades in arms of yesterday, should become to-morrow
his enemies upon the field of battle.</p>

<p class='c006'>Count Francesco received the news with great
gravity, without a sign of anger, or sorrow, or displeasure;
although his situation was becoming really
desperate; for, as the Venetian legate maliciously informed
him, the Venetians were negotiating alliances
with Savoy, with Arragon, and with the Pope. As to
Savoy, Sforza forestalled them; for he forthwith
despatched a messenger to Turin with terms so
advantageous to Duke Louis that that unstable personage
put the Venetians out of mind and settled into
peace with Sforza: who, enabled to turn his entire
force against Venice, drove his late allies back beyond
the Adda, defeated them utterly at Caravaggio, made
peace with them as a victor with success before him,
and in the middle of October turned his arms against
the Milanese republic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sforza had disarmed Savoy and conquered Venice;
but he had not yet come to an end of his enemies. In
November, 1447, Charles of Orleans seriously resumed
his intentions of a Milanese campaign. Already in
July, Burgundy had rewritten to the Venetians entreating
them to favour Orleans; and the council had
replied<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c014'><sup>[80]</sup></a> that though their <em>acts</em> of late may have
appeared hostile to the cause of Orleans, yet nothing
but the instinct of self-preservation had ever induced
them to make peace with Francesco, and their <em>sentiments</em>
were still most loyal to the house of France.
Nothing appeared more likely than a French invasion;
Savoy already had warned the Venetians of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>it. On the 14th of November the Duke of Orleans
wrote to the city of Asti,<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c014'><sup>[79]</sup></a> saying that he was now
positively certain of the alliance with Brittany and
Burgundy, and that before Christmas, his army, under
Jean Focaud, would arrive in Lombardy. This letter,
written in a tone of the cheerfullest high spirits, was
followed a week later by one equally sanguine and
happy: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Dei gratia, omnia negotia Lombardie ad nos
spectantia sunt in his presentibus optime disposita</em></span>.
Jacques Cœur has pronounced himself favourable to
the affair. And on the 4th of December Orleans
writes that the companies of Foix and Bourbon are
on the point of departure; and that John of Angoulême
is arranging with the king for the reinforcement
from the royal troops.</p>

<p class='c006'>But Christmas came, and the phantom armies of
the expectant Orleans remained as visionary as before.
Yet on the 7th of January he writes, still sanguine,
still bent on conquering his castle in the air: “The
army will be larger than we thought; for all the
French princes will lend their aid. Burgundy is
sending great sums of gold and abundant troops into
Lombardy.” The Duke is as full as ever of his schemes
and hopes. But this is the last of his letter; and
before his messenger could bring an answer home
from Asti, Milan had found a master among the ranks
of Italy.</p>

<p class='c006'>For famine and weariness and civil discord had
broken the spirit of the Milanese republic. Even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Savoy, even Venice, were seized with pity, and murmured
to each other that almost any change would
be desirable, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ut hec afflicta et misera Lombardia, dudum
guerrarum disturbijs lacessita, aliquando quiescere
possit; tot populis, tot calamitatibus, totque oppressorum
vocibus compatiendum et miserandum erat</em></span>. Anything
short of the success of Count Francesco would be a
happy alternative to such disaster. And in Milan
itself the discontent was as pronounced. The Guelfs
still vociferated against Francesco, but the Ghibellines,
the party of the nobles, grew slowly and
strongly in favour of the Count. All parties at last
were out of conceit with this miserable liberty, which
was but another name for civil disunion and ruin.
Some were for the Pope, and some for Charles of
France, and these were the Guelfs. Some were for
Savoy, some for the King of Naples. But all these
princes lived a long way off; they had no armies
ready to combat the Venetians, whom each and every
faction dreaded now and hated worse than famine.
When one day Gasparo de Vimercato rose up in
public conclave, and suggested that Milan should give
herself to Count Francesco Sforza, it was incredible
how suddenly the whole mind of the city turned towards
the Count. The Count was the son-in-law of
the late duke. The city was familiar with him. He
was known to be humane and generous and strong.
Should the city elect him, in one day he could dissipate
the famine, the battles, the fear of enemies, and
the suspicion of treachery, which for thirty months
had made the misery of Milan. Leonardo Gariboldo,
Aloigi Trombetta, and Gasparo da Vimercato were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>sent at once to acquaint Count Francesco, that by
the free voice of the people he had been elected lord
of Milan.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the innumerable conspirators, intriguing
diplomatists, and successful tradesmen who filled the
high places of the Italy of that day, Francesco Sforza
appears at least a man. Simple, direct, and brave,
no sudden honour and no reverse of fortune took
from him that natural dignity of a balanced mind
which is one of the finest attributes of the Italian.
Good sense and kindness made a moral force of this
captain of adventure. He disciplined his troops,
erected a court-martial, and punished offences of rape
and violence by death; so that while the miserable
populations of Lombardy had everything to fear from
the other armies that occupied their soil, gradually
they learned to feel themselves secure in the rough,
mailed hands of Count Francesco. Among the
soldiers his reputation was more than mortal. We
have to leap over a dozen generations before the
prestige of the Little Corporal present an analogy to
such devotion. But Count Francesco was loved and
respected even by his enemies; and there is a story
of him which has ever struck me as among the most
charming in military history. It was at the siege of
Como, in that very February of 1450, when, unknown
to him, the Milanese who had so long and so furiously
resisted him, were crying, “Sforza! Sforza!” in an
ecstasy of hungry enthusiasm in the great piazza.
Meanwhile Sforza and his men were occupying Monte
Barro; by means of a little hill in front, overlooking
the Adda, and fortified by five bastions, they kept in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>check the troops of Venice and Milan, ranged in impotent
lines along the further side of the river. The
bulwarks of the little hill were but slight, improvised
in a few days for the occasion, and the poor Italian
artillery of the fifteenth century, wrought no great
destruction; yet such was the spell of Sforza’s name,
that the two armies across the Adda never ventured
to try the place by assault. One night, however, it
leaked out that Count Francesco was not in the fort;
he had gone up the mountain to arrange a fresh
disposition of his troops upon the summit of Monte
Barro. In his absence it was decided to attack the
hill, and in the late February dawn the Venetians and
Milanese poured under the slender bulwarks, armed
with artillery, which silenced that of the fort, and,
planting their scaling ladders against the ramparts,
they soon were in possession of the place. Now, as
it happened, unknown to either army, late at night
Count Francesco had returned home, and hearing
the clamour in the place, he started out of sleep and
strode at once to the ramparts, ignorant that the
enemy had taken the place by surprise and that his
soldiers, unaware of his presence in their midst, had
already given the sign of surrender. “Defend yourselves,
for I am here!” rang out the clear voice of the
Count; and at that moment he perceived that he
stood alone in the midst of his foes. But the mere
fact of his presence was a better defence to his bastions
than a world of soldiers. The assailants, like
chidden children, withdrew from their positions,
dropped the guns and pieces they were carrying away,
and with uncovered heads made for their scaling-ladders.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>As they passed the Count, standing alone
there, they made for his hand—kneeling, crowding to
touch it. “Father and ornament of Italian arms we
salute you,” cried the soft Venetian voices; and in
little knots and groups, as quickly as they might, they
dropped over the walls into the moat again, leaving
Count Francesco the master of his ramparts. It was
to this man, so eminently the hero of his hour, that
the three Milanese delegates brought their news of
the submission of the city.</p>

<p class='c006'>On Feb. 25, 1450, Count Francesco Sforza rode
into Milan. He rode at the head of his troops, and
he had taken care that his future subjects should
welcome the army; for every soldier was hung all
over, from corslet, from waist, from shoulder, and
from arm and hand, with loaves of bread—great
clustering rolls and loaves that hid the armour underneath,
as much as every man could carry. It was
fine, wrote Corio, to see how the famished Milanese
fell upon the troops, avidly tearing the longed-for
food from neck and arm, and falling to at once (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>con
quanta ingordigia!</em></span>) upon the delicious bread. “Sforza!
Sforza!” cried the citizens, a thousand times more
eagerly than before. Some of them cried out in the
words of the Psalms <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Hæc est dies, quam fecit Dominus;
exultemus et lætemur in ea</em></span>! Sforza was in the city;
his troops and his bread had effectually secured his
future. The Venetians might brew another poison.
Charles of Orleans at Chauny might return that loan
of men and gold which his cousin of Burgundy had
lent him. Louis of Savoy wrote to his father at
Lucerne: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Le Comte François a obtenu ceste ville par
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>intelligence, déceptions et pratiques et non mie par force
de guerre</em></span>. All these pretenders, who had felt the bird
already in the hand, must dissemble as best they
might their disappointment. But Genoa<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c014'><sup>[81]</sup></a> and
Florence welcomed the chance of peace, and in
November, 1451, joined in a defensive league with
Milan against the Dauphin, King of France, the Duke
of Savoy, and the Venetians. Lombardy was no longer
the devastated battlefield of doubtful victory. Count
Francesco Sforza was effectually the master of
Milan.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c016'>It is one thing to have a thing by might, another
to hold that thing by right. The theory that might
is right appears sufficient in the hour of conquest, yet
it is but a slender basis for future government; and
Francesco Sforza, safely lodged in Milan, hedged
round with troops, greeted as duke by the very citizens
who had so long repulsed him, was none the less
aware that men regarded him merely in the light of a
successful usurper. Even in Milan there were many
who regretted the loss of a legitimate dynasty; there
were those who looked to the King of Naples, the
adopted heir of the late duke; and there was a party
anxious to proclaim the suzerainty of the Emperor;
and a larger party still who placed their faith in
Charles of Orleans, the legitimate descendant of the
great Giangaleazzo. In the eyes of such men as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>these what claim had Captain Francesco Sforza, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>soi-disant</em></span>>
Duke of Milan? He was merely a successful
soldier, the husband of the late duke’s bastard
daughter, unmentioned as heir to Milan in any testament
or codicil, who by force and famine had succeeded
in imposing himself, as the alternative to
starvation, upon the miserable Milanese. In the
sight of the Emperor, Francesco Sforza had compromised
whatever shadow of right he might once have
had by accepting from the illegal hand of the people
the imperial gift of his duchy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before the feudal law Francesco Sforza was merely
a usurper, and a compromised usurper. To Orleans
he appeared the representative of the illegitimate
branch defrauding the legal heirs of their just claims.
To Arragon, Sforza was the man who pockets treasure
bequeathed expressly to another. The humiliation
of this position is apparent. Yet Sforza, with much
magnanimity, refused to ruin his subjects with
taxes in order to buy the imperial investiture—a purchasable
commodity, as his successors and his predecessors
knew, and one which would have legalized his
situation. At first, in the triumph of success, he
appears to have enjoyed his illegal honours, his glory
as a popular hero; and he affirmed that he preferred
to rest his claims upon the people’s voice. On March
25, 1450, they pronounced him Duke of Milan.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sforza made a good ruler. Under him Milan
ceased to be the prey of miserable dissensions and
disorder, and the streets no longer ran with the cries
of Guelf or Ghibelline. The soldier proved an excellent
despot; not harsh or selfish, as might have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>expected from a man sprung from so little and taught
in so rude a school. He governed the people for the
good of the people, making his own gain but an
accident of their advantage; and that magnanimous
and disastrous impulse which made him refuse to tax
the poor in order to purchase his investiture is
characteristic of the man.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet even in Milan there were many ill content to
thrive under the orderly government of this benevolent
usurper. Many voices that famine had silenced
soon began to whisper—Republicans, Orleanists,
Guelfs, Ghibellines were alike jealous and ill at ease
under the military dictatorship of Sforza. Another
party in the city headed by the Dowager-duchess still
kept alive the pretensions of Savoy, and he was
able to write to Lucerne that on the whole the news
from Milan was not bad, for the people were already
beginning to dislike Francesco Sforza, and that
Madame de Milan proved herself an efficient supporter
of his claims.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if there was discontent in Milan, outside the
walls the success of Sforza was regarded with unqualified
hatred and desire for vengeance. Savoy wished
to oust him from his seat. France and Orleans and
Arragon and Germany thought it sufficient for the
present to brand him as usurper. But the hatred of
the Venetians for the man who once had been their
servant was of a deeper kind, and they did not shrink
from plotting his murder. On April 22, 1450, they
had already decreed his death, and by August 26th
the plan was in full train. The Council had heard
through that gentleman and soldier, Ser Giacobo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Antonio Marcello of Crema, that Vittore dei Scoraderi,
the squire of Francesco, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>est contentus occidere Comitem
Francescum; et sicut omnes intelligere possunt, mors illius
comitis est salus et pax nostra et totius Italiæ</em></span>. Nothing
was to be sent in writing to this person which might
compromise the Venetian Senate, but Marcello was
instructed to offer him ample terms. Further injunctions
were despatched on September 2nd, and early in
December we hear again of a candidate, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>una persona
intelligente et discreta</em></span>, not a Venetian subject, who
promised to despatch Count Francesco with <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>aliqua
venenosa materies</em></span>.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c014'><sup>[82]</sup></a> To this intelligent assistant the
Council recommended the use of certain little round
pellets which, thrown upon the fire, exhale a most
sweet and delectable odour; but before they were
despatched for experiment on so illustrious a subject
a secret trial was to be given them in Venice on the
person of a prisoner condemned to death for larceny.
In May, 1451, the Council added three other persons
to the conspiracy, and by June the proffered reward
had grown to the extravagant sum of 5,000 ducats,
with a yearly revenue of 1,000 ducats in addition,
and liberty to recall four exiles. In return for so
much munificence it is expected that Count Francesco
“shall by your industry be despatched before
the end of October.” But in August an extension of
leave was granted until December. Then the messages
became frequent; and it is easy to divine that
the noble person who is to despatch the Count is none
other than Innocentio Cotta, a man of one of the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Guelf houses of Milan, who, despite his blue blood,
was the most ardent champion of popular rights, and
who is familiar to the readers of Corio’s history as
the head and front of that little group of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>nobili audacissimi</em></span>,
who in 1459, unbroken by famine and long
misery, spurred the people of Milan on to resist the
arms of Sforza, and plundered the party of the
Ghibellines for money to furnish troops to defend the
city. The success of Count Francesco had added ruin
to the chagrin and hatred of this man, and one of
the conditions that Cotta demanded of the Venetians
was that he should regain <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>quelle forteze, terre e possessioni
mie chio goldeva al tempo de la felice memoria del
duca passato</em></span>. To this man, even as to the Council,
it appeared that the death of Count Francesco could
only be useful and fertile in good (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>practica non potest
esse nisi utilis et fructuosa, quum ex ea nullum damnum
sequi potest</em></span>), and with the sentiments less of an
assassin than of a lofty classic tyrannicide—a character
ever dear to the Italians—Innocentio Cotta
received, in his Brescian exile, the little round and
perfumed pellets of poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>No less than eighteen times between the August of
1448 and the December of 1453 did the Venetian
Council instigate their assistant to the deed. Poisons
were despatched to him and apparently administered.
But the venom of the Venetians was more odious
than fatal. Their poisons, sublimated from an irrational
medley of volatile substances, had no regular
chemical action, and the receipts of them which
remain exhibit an incoherent confusion of mercury,
sal-volatile, copperas, cantharides, burned yeast, salts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>of nitre and arsenic, from which, after the endless
simmerings and powderings of their preparation, the
most deadly qualities had evaporated, and which left
(according to the analysis of Professor Boutlerow) a
comparatively harmless combination of ammoniacal
chlorides.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sedative prescription made no perceptible effect
upon the iron constitution of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>soi-disant</em></span> Duke of
Milan. He probably remained in total ignorance of
the poison so frequently administered in the unbroken
Venice glasses; but he could not remain equally unaware
of the distaste and suspicion which environed
him, and he grew to desire some superior show of
legality. The troops and bread, with which he had
convinced the Milanese, were admirable agents, but
they could not do everything. Francesco Sforza had
six young sons, and in his heart there increased that
invincible longing to found a dynasty which has
overcome so many conquerors. Somewhere in the
Archives, he began to think, in some unfound testament
or neglected codicil, there must be surely some
mention of his wife, the late Duke’s only child.
With possession already in its favour, the slightest
mention in the old Duke’s will would serve to legalize
the dynasty of Sforza. But nowhere in will or codicil
was there any last reversion in favour of Madonna
Bianca. The searchers only brought to light the
testament of Giangaleazzo, which bequeathed Milan,
failing direct male heirs, to the sons of his daughter
Valentine.</p>

<p class='c006'>Still, if Francesco Sforza could not legalize his own
succession, he could at least secure himself against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>the raising of better-founded claims. On February
19, 1452,<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c014'><sup>[83]</sup></a> Count Francesco wrote to Andriano Oliari
of Pavia (the Oliari were a family of notaries to whom
for generations the Archives of Milan were entrusted)
commanding him to come at once to Milan and to
bring with him to the palace the original will of
Giangaleazzo Visconti,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“for [he explained], because of certain matters</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Oliari and his father before him had been servants
of the legal Dukes. Something in the tone of Sforza’s
letter, its awkward mingling of the menace and the
bribe, gave pause to the faithful notary. He had no
mind to render up so sacred a deposit to the tender
mercies of this blunt old soldier, who signed himself
“Cichus” (Frank), and who was wholly without the
dignity of the legitimate tyrants. Oliari wrote back
and said that he believed a copy of the original will
would be found to answer every purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>The so-called Duke of Milan was irate, and despatched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>a curt letter to the suspicious and insubordinate
lawyer, and by the same messenger he sent
a line to the Castellan of Pavia, informing him that
Oliari had not come, and bidding him despatch the
notary at once, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>cum dicto testamento et non cum la
copia</em></span>. But neither the Duke nor the constable of the
castle could induce Oliari to go back from his decision.
“I really cannot come,” he replied to Sforza on February
24th, “for I have neither money nor horses.”
Now Pavia is not so long a journey from Milan, but
that, to serve a sovereign, a man might borrow his
neighbour’s hackney. The same day, the 24th, the
Duke replied in anger, both to Oliari and to the
castellan, that he could not conceive why it should
be so difficult to come at the said testament. “And
forasmuch as you hold dear our favour, and under
pain of rebellion, you must be here with us to-morrow
with the said will, for if you dost not come we will
make you repent it.” Oliari dared not hold out
against so ominous a command. He made in secret
five copies of the precious document, and then we
may suppose that he took the original to Sforza, for
no more letters require it from his custody. Thus
the original will of Giangaleazzo Visconti was destroyed.</p>

<p class='c006'>But while Sforza was stooping to a crime in order
to protect himself against the rivalry of Orleans, as a
fact that pretender was less dangerous than he had
been before. However good his claim might be, his
inefficiency was a terrible counterpoise. When,<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c014'><sup>[85]</sup></a> at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>the new year of 1454, Alfonso the Magnanimous wrote
to Venice requesting the government to continue their
relations with Orleans, the Venetians replied that
Orleans was too far off and too unready. They were
as desirous as Arragon to get rid of the usurper. A
month before they strove to enlist Arragon in favour
of their novel candidate, they had written to Savoy,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c014'><sup>[84]</sup></a>
asking Duke Louis to join with them in requesting
the Dauphin of France to invade Italy and suppress
Francesco Sforza. They proposed that the Dauphin
should conquer the Ticinese and Piacenza for himself,
and the Duchy of Milan for the Duke of Orleans. In
case the Duke was not minded to go to this expense
and danger for a cousin’s sake, the Venetians let it be
understood that any French prince would be agreeable
to them upon the throne of Milan.</p>

<p class='c016'>The House of Orleans had no more dangerous
enemy than the royal house of France. Matters had
greatly changed since, immediately after the liberation
of Orleans, Charles VII. had seconded his claim
to the Milanese. The reduction to insignificance of
the great feudal houses in general, and particularly
the reduction of Orleans, was now the policy of the
French crown; and at that moment the policy of the
already inscrutable Dauphin appears to have been
the conquest of a kingdom which should comprise the
Dauphiny, the Ticinese, Asti, the Piacentine angle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>the Emilia, and the entire stretch of Liguria. To
the restless contriver of a plan so bold the claims
of Sforza and of Orleans came equally amiss; and, in
secret, the chief enemy of either credulous pretender
was the Dauphin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sforza, however, had little to fear from Orleans, and
less from the French. In fact, in King Charles he
found at this difficult period his ablest friend. The
records of the Archives of Milan, from the year 1452
until the death of King Charles, abound in friendly
letters, and are evidence of the cordial relations
existing not only between the Duke of Milan and the
King of France, but between the House of Sforza and
the royal Governor of Asti. In 1459 the King besought
Francesco to ask the hand of the little
Princess Marie d’Orléans for his only son; but we
may presume that Orleans would not consent to so
much recognition of the usurper, for the negotiation
came to nothing. Yet with the Court of France
Francesco continued on terms of affectionate friendship
and mutual respect.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1453 the Dauphin still had designs on Italy, and
offered to the Venetian Signory his aid in Italy to
combat Count Francesco.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c014'><sup>[86]</sup></a> It was arranged that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>should come with from eight to ten thousand men,
dispossess Sforza, and conquer for himself a Duchy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>of Milan to extend from Adda to Ticino, from Padua
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>beyond Piacenza. Or, if the King and the Dauphin
would guarantee the army, Venice professed herself
willing to aid the Duke of Orleans in the same undertaking.
But while these princes were arranging their
future conquests, a spirit stronger than they was
making these conquests impossible—a spirit which, a
score of years ago, had begun to draw together Scotland
and England, those ancient enemies, to the
alarm of France; a spirit which had estranged Burgundy
and Brittany from their English companions
in so many battles, and which was leading them to
the feet of the long-despised and outraged King of
France; a spirit which now should reconcile Venice
with Sforza, Florence with Milan, and make, for a
brief moment of millennium, those immemorial foes
at peace together; a spirit which awoke in these
middle years of the fifteenth century—aroused Heaven
knows whence or how—and strangely changed the
world it breathed across: I have named the spirit of
Nationality.</p>

<p class='c006'>At Christmas-time in 1453 the Venetians spared
neither pains nor prayers nor promise to induce the
Dauphin to come and suppress Count Francesco
Sforza. In April of the next year<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c014'><sup>[89]</sup></a> they sent to tell
him, as delicately as possible, that they had no
further need of his services (a refined way of informing
him that they would oppose him), since they had
made peace with the man whom four months ago
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>they had called the Common Enemy of his countrymen,
and whom they had so many times endeavoured
to assassinate. And probably the Dauphin was not
sorry. For the spirit that animated these Italians
inspired him also. Already it had touched his intelligent
and sensitive spirit. Already, in 1447,<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c014'><sup>[88]</sup></a> he
had laughed for joy when the French lost Genoa, and
had declared <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“le Roy se gouvernoit si mal qu’on ne
pouvoit pis.”</span> In the five years between 1445 and
1450 the Dauphin had passed from the friendship of
Orleans to the friendship of Burgundy, and his ideal
had changed. He raged to see the King prefer Italy
to the north, and amuse himself with taking Genoa
and securing Asti when he should have set to conquering
Normandy. He said aloud that the true
place for such a King as that was in such a Hermitage
as the Duke of Savoy’s. He plotted to seize the government
of affairs himself, and leave the King, in prosperous
desuetude, to amuse himself with his Belle
Agnès and his pleasures. As we know, the plot fell
through, and the impatient Dauphin, a discomfited
fugitive, was himself the one to seek a hermitage at
the Court of Burgundy. There he spent five years of
chafing exile and mortification while his father ruled
France, not unsuccessfully, after his own fashion, pursuing
shadows indeed in Italy, yet at home administering
affairs and inventing a regular army with no less
zeal and skill for this extraneous ambition. Louis
was still at the Court of Philip of Burgundy when, in
1461, he heard the news of his father’s death. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>the prince who, of all others, should do most for the
reintegration of his country ascended the throne of
France.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c014'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>As we know, the law of historic necessity required
that the Dauphin should renounce his ambition of a
North Italian state—he had, in fact, already renounced
it; that he should abandon his early visions and his
early friends, and adopt for his counsellors the very
men who once had ruined him. Henceforth he must
bend the whole strength of his spirit to the furthering
of that policy which he had so long, and at so great a
sacrifice, resisted and attempted to destroy. The interests
of the time required that France should
forego all ambitions foreign to herself in order to
consolidate herself; that she should sacrifice the
south in order to insure the north; that she should
also sacrifice the aristocracy to the people; and
Louis XI., who, as a prince, had paid so dear for his
adherence to the rights of the nobles, became the
monarch who more than any other was governed by
men of low and base condition—who more than any
other oppressed and resisted the pride of feudalism.
Those who had been his friends became his enemies;
those likewise who had been his enemies became his
friends. Francesco Sforza, from whom he had been
so eager to take his duchy, became the one man alive
whom he admired and respected. Yes, this successful
captain of adventure, who for years had prevented
him in Milan, in Naples, and in Genoa, who once had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>been the chief stumbling-block in the path of the
Dauphin, became the corner-stone of the policy of
the King. Like Catherine de’ Medici, like Rodrigo
Borgia, like most unscrupulous rulers, there was
something oddly magnanimous in the moral indifference
of Louis IX. Sforza never suffered for
his enmity of yore. The new King of France
was a being as destitute of rancour as devoid of
gratitude.</p>

<p class='c006'>With Savoy, Orleans, Dunois, and Anjou the new
king was ill-disposed to treat. He had learned the
secret of their intrigues and their ambitions. On
May 10, 1463, he wrote to Sforza that he was content
to come to an understanding with Milan, if Milan
would utterly disavow Savoy. This conspirator, versed
since boyhood in all the dismal ins and outs of
treachery, was too well aware of the tricks of his
confederates.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c014'><sup>[90]</sup></a> It still might be possible that his
enemies were honest. They at least were the only
people he could trust; and more than any other he
confided in Francesco Sforza. In December, 1463,
he made to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>de facto</em></span> Duke of Milan the significant
cession of the French claim to Genoa.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c014'><sup>[91]</sup></a> He also
arranged for the cession of Savona. Negotiations
were even begun for yielding Asti to Francesco
Sforza; but the inhabitants declared that they
would stand by the house of Orleans.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>At first the cousins of the King could not believe
that he had actually abandoned them—he who had
begun his career as the pupil of Dunois, and had
suffered so long as the champion of the nobles. So
late as October 10, 1465, the descendants of Valentine
Visconti sent a very secret embassy to Venice<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c014'><sup>[92]</sup></a>
to propose to the Ten a league between their government
and the Duke of Orleans, the Count of Angoulême,
and the Duke of Brittany, for the purpose of
ousting the usurper, Count Francesco, and delivering
the Duchy of Milan to Charles of Orleans. This
league, which could not be confirmed by the Pope,
a political adversary, might, it was suggested, be
headed by the King of France. Probably the Venetians
were better informed as to the real intentions
of Louis XI. Certainly they knew that it was
too late or too early to dream of dislodging the Sforzas
from Milan. They replied that they loved the house of
France, but that peace also was dear to them: they
begged to be excused from attacking Count Francesco.</p>

<p class='c006'>After this for many years the house of Orleans
ceased to struggle. Before the year was out Charles
of Orleans was dead, and the French pretender to the
crown of Milan was only an infant, three years old.
Before the child was six Dunois was also dead.
Dunois—who had not suffered the children of his
adoptive mother to be cheated of their inheritance in
Asti—would, had he lived, have instructed his nephew
in the details of his claim to Milan. But Louis II. of
Orleans, born in his father’s seventy-second year, was
naturally doomed to lose in infancy his father’s contemporaries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>As the child grew up every link was
severed that might have bound him to the past, and
he knew little or nothing of the pretensions of his
house. His mother, who had a romantic worship for
the memory of Valentine Visconti, related to her son
many a legend of the quasi-royal power which during
the last century his ancestors possessed. But that
supremacy seemed at an end for ever. In France, in
Italy, the star of Orleans suffered a long eclipse. By
his own experience in rebellion Louis XI. was aware
how dangerous to the Crown and how disastrous to
the kingdom was the power of the great feudal houses.
Alençon and Armagnac and many another he diminished
by confiscation and captivity; Dunois, Bourbon,
Saint-Vallier, Sancerre, he attached to the Crown by
royal marriages. Kinship in subjection, independence
in imprisonment: these were the two alternatives
presented by the King to the nobles of France.
Among the most unfortunate of those who accepted
the former gift was the young Louis d’Orléans. Louis
XI. had decided that with this young man the house
of Orleans should end; and when its representative
was eleven years of age, the King married him to
Jeanne of France, a gentle girl, deformed, incapable
of offspring, and so ugly that when she was brought
to court for her wedding the king himself exclaimed:
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Je ne la croyais pas si laide</em></span>. To this bride the young
duke was married in 1473. “They will have no expense
with a nursery,” wrote the malicious King to
Dammartin: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>ils n’auraient guères à besoigner et nourrir
les enfans qui viendraient du dit mariage: mais toutefois
se feroit-il</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Meanwhile the six sons of Sforza had grown to
manhood; and the eldest ruled in Milan, accepted,
by the mere fact of his unchallenged succession, as
the lawful inheritor of his father’s duchy.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VI.</h3>

<p class='c016'>When Louis II. of Orleans had reached the age of
twenty he was the best archer, the most dexterous
horseman, the most adroit and brilliant man-at-arms
about the Court of France. He was handsome, fond
of the arts, and well instructed. He had an engaging
manner, gentle, gracious, and benign. A brave and
eager cavalier, he was ready for adventures; but a
strong hand kept him down, a hand whose cruel restraint
was never lifted from that audacious brow.
Suddenly the pressure ceased: the hand was gone;
on August 30, 1483, King Louis died.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was succeeded by a child of fourteen, an ugly,
ignorant youth, who had grown up neglected in the
castle of Amboise, far from the Court, alone with his
gentle forsaken mother, Charlotte of Savoy, who had
taught him the only thing she knew, the plots of innumerable
romances of chivalry. For Louis XI.,
partly afraid of injuring the delicate constitution of
his only heir, and partly remembering his own dangerous
and rebellious childhood, denied any solid education
to his son. He never saw the boy, leaving him
for years at a time to grow up as best he might alone
with his mother at Amboise. “Let the body grow
strong first,” said the King; “the mind will look to
itself.” And, according to tradition, the sole food
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>that he provided for the eager mind of his son was
one single Latin maxim: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Qui nescit dissimulare nescit
regnare</em></span>. This was all the Latin that was taught to
Charles VIII., and on this solitary morsel of classic
attainment he was never known to act. Louis XI.,
for all his subtlety, had forgotten that by simply withholding
one sort of education you cannot insured
vacuity. The child at Amboise knew nothing of
history, nothing of geography, nothing of the classics.
But his mind was stuffed with the deeds of Roland
and Ogier, and the beauty of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>La belle dame sans merci</em></span>.
Suddenly one summer day, unwonted messengers
knocked at the gates of Amboise; they fetched the
child away to see an old, misshapen, suspicious man,
whom he did not know—who was his father. The
next day Charles VIII. was king of France under the
regency of his married sister, Anne de Bourbon.
Madame Anne inherited her father’s dislike and distrust
of Orleans; but her sister was his wife and
adored him, and her brother, the king, admired him.
She did her best to repress Orleans in France; but
her hand, though firm, had not the solidity of her
father’s. Orleans grew and expanded.</p>

<p class='c006'>Just at this moment Venice was in sore distress.
Almost every power in Italy was against her, and she
turned for help to France. On January 16, 1484, she
sent Antonio Loredan to Charles VIII., complaining
of the aggressions of Naples, Milan, and Ferrara, and
desiring a resumption of the Franco-Venetian league
of Louis XI. That league had been a very tame and
passive piece of policy; the Venetians hoped a bolder
favour from a younger king. Loredan was bidden to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>insist upon the suggestion that the kingdom of Naples
occupied by Ferdinand of Arragon, belonged in fact
to France.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c014'><sup>[95]</sup></a> “Nor content with that,” run the instructions
of the Senate, “this king it was who instigated
Lodovico Sforza to the usurpation of Milan.”
Lodovico il Moro,<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c014'><sup>[94]</sup></a> the fourth son of Count Francesco
Sforza, had, as a matter of fact, usurped the position
of his nephew in 1481, and, though nominally regent,
conducted himself as Duke of Milan. But this intrusion
was not the seizure which now the Venetians
meant to blame. They wished to suggest, as the
lawful claimant, not the young son of Galeazzo
Sforza, but the Duke of Orleans.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Express to the Duke of Orleans in secret our
desire for his exaltation [run the instructions given to
Loredan], and explain to him how good is the opportunity
for him to recover the Duchy of Milan, which
belongs to him by right; and how his claim would be
favoured by the differences and dissidences at present
existing between ourselves and Milan, as also by the
discontent of the Milanese with their tyrants. Inform
the Duke that Lodovico Sforza aspires to seize
the sovereignty for himself, amid the murmurs of his
people, and that he will certainly massacre all who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>uphold the claim of the Duchess Bona. Inflame and
excite as best you can the Duke of Orleans to pursue
this enterprise, ... and if the French should choose
to make good their claim to Naples as against the
tyrant Ferdinand, they could not find a better time
than now.”<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c014'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>This is the programme of the great invasions of
1494 and 1500; but the times were not yet ripe. On
February 4th the Ten despatched a second missive to
the Duke of Orleans,<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c014'><sup>[96]</sup></a> instigating him to the speedy
conquest of Milan, and offering him the entire Venetian
army for this service. The young Duke appears
to have taken these proposals very seriously, and the
project created some disturbance and quarrelling
at Court. But the Venetians were incapable of
any sustained policy in foreign affairs; to serve
Venice in the way that at the moment appeared
most advantageous was their only aim, and thus their
attitude was one of constant unrest. In August they
made peace with Naples and Milan, and sent word to
Orleans that they were glad to hear that all disunion
was at an end between him and the King. The same
thing had happened in Italy. Peace had set in under
the happiest auspices, and a fraternal affection united
the King of Naples and the Regent of Milan with the
Venetian Senate.</p>

<p class='c006'>So ended the project for a French succession. Louis
of Orleans, thwarted of his foreign ambition, strove
for greatness at home, and contested the regency with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Anne of Bourbon. The civil war, the flight into
Brittany, the pretensions of Louis to the hand of his
beautiful cousin (the heiress to that duchy), the defeat
of the Orleanist troops at Saint-Aubin on July 28,
1488, and the three years’ captivity of the Duke, are
matters of common knowledge. But as Charles VIII.
grew out of the tutelage of his sister, more and more
he grew to favour his imprisoned cousin. There was
little to fear from him now that the King was a major,
and Anne of Brittany the Queen of France. In 1491
the Duke was released; and when in 1494 Charles
at the head of his troops invaded Italy, Louis of
Orleans preceded him across the mountains, chief in
command, master of the fleet, destined to drive the
Neapolitans from Genoa, and thence to lead the fleet
of France into the port of Naples.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VII.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The invasion of Italy by Charles VIII. appeared,
even to contemporaries, a miracle. The young King,
ill advised, without generals, without money, with the
impromptu army of a moment’s whim, traversed
hostile Italy as glorious as Charlemagne. Charlemagne,
in fact, was the true leader of his forces: for
that glorious phantom marched before him, filling
with dread the hearts of the enemy, and blinding
them to the actual penury of the invader. With the
events of that romantic campaign we have no business
at this moment, for, notwithstanding his commission
to lead the fleet to Naples, the Duke of Orleans did
not go south of Lombardy. While Orleans was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>gaining the battle of Rapallo, suddenly the King
arrived at Asti. It was Sept. 9th, a malarious season.
Across the wide plain, the marshy fields of Lombardy,
Orleans galloped, fresh from victory, to a council with
the King. He had scarcely arrived at Asti when
Charles fell ill of the small-pox. The attack was
slight, and within a fortnight he recovered. But the
very day the King began to mend, Orleans sickened
of a quartan ague, and when his cousin was well
again and ready, on Oct. 6th, to set out for Naples,
Orleans was still unfit to take the road. He sent his
company south with the royal troops, and with a
handful of squires and servants remained behind in
his hereditary county of Asti, among the subjects who
had loved his father, and who had served himself,
far-off, unseen, through years of peril and intrigue,
with as devoted and chivalrous a spirit of loyalty as
ever the highlanders of Jacobite Scotland dedicated
to an absent Stuart.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sforza and Orleans were now the nearest neighbours,
bound to each other by their interest in the
King. Fate has seldom brought about more ironic
complication. When Lodovico Sforza, out of revenge
and anger towards King Ferdinand, had revived the
French claim to Naples, and had instigated Charles
to enter Italy, he had not foreseen the accident that
left the Duke of Orleans within a league or two of
Milan. Charles VIII. entered Italy as the friend and
guest of Lodovico il Moro, the Regent of Milan. To
the external and uninitiated world the French claim
to the duchy appeared about as actual as the claim
of the English kings to France. Lodovico il Moro,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>familiar with the France of Louis XI., knew that the
claims of Orleans were not likely to be countenanced
by the throne.</p>

<p class='c006'>The present is never clear to us. Its Archives, its
Secreta, are not given over to our perusal. Lodovico
il Moro was probably uninstructed in that secret
policy of the Venetian Senate which, in 1483, had so
strongly urged the half-forgotten rights of Orleans.
But we, familiar with those silent manuscripts, are
not surprised to find that no sooner had the King
gone south than Venice and Florence began to interfere
with Orleans. The very day the King left Asti,<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c014'><sup>[97]</sup></a>
a secret messenger from Piero de’ Medici entered the
city. His errand was to Orleans. In their desire to
stop the progress of Charles VIII., and in their hatred
of Lodovico who had invoked the stranger, the Italian
princes proposed to offer Milan to the French in place
of Naples. Orleans himself suggested, unknown to
his chivalrous young cousin, that the King would be
satisfied if Ferdinand would pay him homage for
Naples, and, besides a war indemnity, a yearly
pension such as the kings of France pay to England.
For himself, and as a just fine on Lodovico, he intimated
that the Duchy of Milan might be divided
between the houses of Orleans and Sforza. But as
time went on, and the arms of France were everywhere
successful, he grew bolder in his demands, and
“Milan for the heir of the Visconti” was his cry.</p>

<p class='c006'>But Charles, ignorant of the intrigues of Orleans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>and Florence, of Venice and of Sforza (who also for
his private ends wished the King to keep this side the
Apennines), crossed the southern range as he had
crossed the Alps, and by the new year he was in
Rome. Then, afraid of the French success, the
Italians began to draw back from their conspiracy
with Orleans. They had wished the French to take
Milan instead of Naples, but Milan as well as Naples
was too much.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VIII.</h3>

<p class='c016'>When the French had entered Italy, Orleans had
had no legal rival to his claim, unless, indeed, the
Emperor be called his rival. To the people of Lombardy,
oppressed by taxes, hating their tyrant, he
appeared as the rightful heir, the last of the Visconti.
Round the history of a past not yet remote there
had grown a mist through which all things appeared
of vague, heroic, and mysterious proportions, of
which the King Arthur, the legendary glory, was the
first duke—“Saint Giangaleazzo,” as one of the
brothers of Pavia called him in the presence of
Commines. “This saint of yours,” cried the amused
historian, “was a great and wicked, though most
honourable, tyrant.” “That may be,” said the
brother; “we call him saint because he did good to
our order.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This was also the feeling of the Milanese, for whom
Giangaleazzo had invented security and peace, for
whom he had conquered immense possessions. They
forgot his sins, his crimes, and the first duke became
the hero of the place. To be the last descendant of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>this man seemed in itself a claim to inherit his
possessions, to sit in his place, to expel the usurper.
While this was their feeling, in October the usurper died.</p>

<p class='c006'>Giangaleazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan, a youth of
five-and-twenty, kept in prison by his uncle, the
Regent Lodovico, died no less suspiciously than the
little princes in the Tower. He left behind him a
son four years old, his legitimate successor. But,
with ominous prevision, a year before this time,
Lodovico the regent had negotiated with the Emperor
to obtain the reversion of the duchy. He had admitted
that his father, his brother, his nephew were
no more than illegal usurpers: moreover they had
prejudiced the rights of the empire by receiving their
titles only from the people. Thus the infant son of
Giangaleazzo was the son, not merely of a usurper,
but of a man who had forfeited whatever rights he
originally had. Conceding this, Lodovico besought
the Emperor, of his free grace and bounty, to bestow
the duchy on himself and his descendants, even as
once before an emperor had bestowed Milan upon a
man who had no legal claim—namely, on Giangaleazzo
Visconti. Maximilian consented, and on Sept.
5, 1494, the Imperial letters of promise<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c014'><sup>[98]</sup></a> were despatched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>from Antwerp, letters for which the Regent
paid the sum of 100,000 ducats.</p>

<p class='c006'>This document, kept in the deepest privacy, can
have arrived in Milan but a few days before Giangaleazzo
died. Every one believed that the young man
had died of poison. It was a piteous thing. But the
son of the murdered man was only four years old;
and the French were in Lombardy—the guests of
Lodovico. “To be short,” says Commines, “Lodovico
had himself declared Duke of Milan, and that,
as I think, was his only end in bringing us across the
mountains.” Terrorised by the presence of the
French, the people hailed the Regent as their duke,
“and crying <em>Duca! Duca!</em>” (wrote Corio), “and
having robed him in the ducal mantle, they set him
on horseback, and he rode to the temple, the men of
his faction proclaiming him the while, and they set
the joy-bells ringing, while all this time the dead body
of Giangaleazzo was lying still unburied in the great
cathedral.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Conscious of the secret diploma in his pocket,
Lodovico could enjoy the pleasure of this ceremony
with a feeling of security. Yet his crown did not sit
quite smoothly on his brows. Orleans in Asti was
assuming an intolerable air of patronage. And
behind that thin row of partisans shouting with their
hired voices, “<em>Duca! Duca!</em>” there was a sullen,
silent crowd. Those, and the rest of Italy, believed
that Lodovico had poisoned the father in order to
usurp the inheritance of the child, Francesco. Of the
three pretenders, by far the most popular was the unconscious
infant, who bore so quaintly in his mother’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>arms the beloved and redoubtable name of his
grandfather, the great condottiere. “Nearly all the
Milanese,” wrote Commines, “would have revolted to
the King had he only followed Trivulzio’s advice and
set up the arms of the child-duke.” But Charles
refused to injure the claims of his cousin of Orleans.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile the relations between the French and
Lodovico were growing difficult and strained. The
presence of Orleans in Asti, the miraculous success of
Charles, inspired the Duke of Milan with the bitterest
regret that ever he had called his allies across the
mountains. He had used them as a weapon, and now
their use had passed. When, on Feb. 27, 1495, he
heard the news that the French had entered Naples,
he simulated every sign of joy. But while the bells
were still ringing in the steeples, he drew aside the
Venetian envoy. “I have had bad news,” he whispered.
“Naples is lost. Let us form a league
against the common enemy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This was in the end of February. During the next
month there was much secret business in the diplomatic
world. Ever since the entry of the French into
Rome the great powers had looked unkindly on the
triumph of Charles VIII. The Emperor beheld with
dismay the alliance of Ghibelline Milan and the
Ghibelline Colonna with the King of France. The
Pope believed with reason that France, the Colonna,
and the Savelli might depose a pontiff so unpopular
as Alexander VI. Ferdinand and Isabella declared
that the intention of Charles was nothing less than to
make himself the king of Italy and then proceed to
conquer Spain. So likely did it seem that this ungainly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>limping, ill-instructed youth might justify
the name he had assumed—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Carolus Octavus, Secundus
Magnus</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c006'>At Venice in the dead of the night the secret council
used to meet. There, with the Venetian Senate, the
ambassadors of Germany, Castile and Arragon, and
Milan conferred together. They were negotiating a
league to expel the French from Italy. On March
31st, while Charles was still shut in the Neapolitan
trap, the quintuple alliance was proclaimed. The last
name among the allies was the name of the man
who had called Charles into Italy, now given for the
first time among his equals his new dignity of Duke
of Milan. Lodovico hastened to legalize this official
recognition. In May the Imperial privilege, formally
promised in the preceding autumn, arrived at Milan.
In presence of the Imperial envoys the privilege was
read aloud at Lodovico’s solemn coronation.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>IX.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Lodovico had sprung a disagreeable surprise upon
the Duke of Orleans, for his title, derived directly
from Maximilian, was now as good as that of Giangaleazzo
Visconti himself. To conquer Milan by arms,
to force the Emperor into revoking the privilege of
1495, to induce him to grant a new one confirming
the Visconti succession—this was the only course that
remained to Orleans.</p>

<p class='c006'>Secret as the Council had been at Venice, it had
not escaped the notice of Commines, who wrote in
March to Orleans bidding him look to the walls of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>Asti, and sent a messenger to Bourbon in France
bidding him despatch a reinforcement to the scanty
force of Orleans. The young Duke at Asti was not
sorry to receive the message. He had now been six
months in Lombardy; he had done nothing; and he
was eager to come to battle with Lodovico. To all
the French, by this time, Il Moro appeared a traitor
and a secret poisoner. To Louis of Orleans he
appeared all this and also the usurper of his inheritance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Great were the pomp and beauty of Milan in the
year 1495, humbled as yet by no centuries of foreign
servitude, ruined by no battles and untouched by
time. Wonderful in the fresh whiteness of its stately
cathedral; delicate with the unblurred beauty of the
new frescoes by Lionardo; rich with statuary, broken
now and lost for ever; gay with the clear fine moulding
of its rose-red palaces, Milan in the rich plain
was a fountain of wealth to its possessor. When
Orleans beheld this earthly paradise of the Renaissance,
his claim to Milan, which had been at first but
a shadowy pretension, took certainty and substance in
his mind. And as the attention of the young man
was drawn to his Visconti ancestors, and to the
marriage of his grandfather with the daughter of the
Duke of Milan, he and his counsellors began to reconstruct
the half-forgotten title that he had to
Milan.</p>

<p class='c006'>No one was very clear as to the point. The ducal
secretaries found themselves compelled to suppose,
to invent. Nicole Gilles, the chief of them, declared
that Filippo Maria Visconti had married Madame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Bonne, daughter of King John of France (a lady who
had she existed, would have been a good forty years
older than her husband), by whom he had two girls,
Valentine, who married the Duke of Orleans, and
Bonne, who married the lord of Montauban in Brittany.
Besides these he had a bastard child, Bianca
Maria, the wife of Sforza.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is perhaps the clearest of these singular
genealogies <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>pour rire</em></span>. Louis was glad to escape
from their confusion and bewilderment to the plain
issues of the field of battle. There seemed a good
chance for him. Lodovico was so hated by his
subjects<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c014'><sup>[99]</sup></a> that they would welcome almost any
change. Almost at the same moment that Piacenza
offered herself to King Charles if he would undertake
to support the child Francesco, the cities of Milan,
Pavia, and Novara were secretly practising with
Orleans, and Commines declares he would have been
received in Milan with greater rejoicings than in his
town of Blois.</p>

<p class='c006'>On April 17th Lodovico il Moro insolently summoned
Orleans to quit Asti and cross the Alps again with all
his men. Thanks to the warning of Commines, Orleans
already had fortified the town.</p>

<p class='c018'>“This place,” he replied,<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c014'><sup>[100]</sup></a> “and its dependent
castles are a part of my inheritance, and to put them
in other hands, and to go away and leave my own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>possessions, is a thing that I never meant to do.
Tell your master,” he added to the messenger, “that
he will find me ready for combat, either waiting for
him here or going forth to meet him on the field of
battle. I have received a commission from the King,
and it is my intention to fulfil it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Unfortunately, the real commission that Orleans
had received from his cousin was to keep quiet and
on no account to break the peace (for the league was
defensive, and did not menace the royal troops if they
retired without offence) until Charles and his diminished
army had arrived at Asti. They would be in
imminent peril if any rash act of Orleans should let
loose upon them, amid the bewildering passes of the
mountains, the eager concourse of their vigilant
enemies. But Orleans did not remember this. He
was burning for personal conflict with his rival,
indignant at his treachery, and persuaded that he
could easily secure the whole of Lombardy to France.
Thrice in April he wrote to Bourbon entreating succour.
“Only send me the reinforcements at once,
and I think I shall do the King a service that men
will talk of many a year.” The forces came; and
Orleans saw himself the master of 5,000 foot, 100
archers, 1,300 <a id='corr262.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='men-at arms'>men-at-arms</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_262.25'><ins class='correction' title='men-at arms'>men-at-arms</ins></a></span> or thereabouts, and two
fine pieces of artillery.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c014'><sup>[101]</sup></a> He was aware that Lodovico
was so out-at-elbows that he could not pay his
army. He knew the discontent of Lombardy. He
felt himself so much older and wiser than the King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>that he found it hard to obey his commands. His
secret practice with the nobles of the Lombard cities
informed him that all was ripe for a sudden stroke.
On the last night of May, in the safety of the dark,
twenty men-at-arms under Jean de Louvain rode out
from Asti across the Lombard plain, until at daybreak
on June 1st they reached the gate of San Stefano
at Novara. The gate was opened to them by the
factors of the Opicini, two nobles of the place; the
citizens ran out to meet the French; the handful of
Sforzesco troops within the town barred themselves
in the citadel. By June 13th, Orleans, with the flower</p>

<p class='c006'>No sooner was he there than, first Pavia, then
Milan, offered to receive him. He ought to have
gone at once, before the armies of his enemies could
encircle him in Novara. But his whole soul was
invaded by a deep distrust of the Italians. It seemed
safer to temporise until the royal troops came up.
Long before these could possibly arrive, on June 22nd,
the Venetians protected Milan with 1,000 Grecian
stradiots, 2,000 foot, 1,000 cuirassiers.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c014'><sup>[102]</sup></a> It was now
impossible to take Milan, which a little boldness
might easily have gained. It was impossible even to
evacuate Novara. And when, after many difficulties
heroically overcome, the little army of Charles arrived in
Asti on July 27th, sorely in need of rest and of refreshment,
a new and arduous task awaited it; for Orleans
and his soldiers were perishing of hunger in besieged
Novara.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>X.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Commines has set dramatically before us the
division between the army and the council of the
King. He himself warmly espoused the cause of the
army, which frankly declared a battle impossible
against such overwhelming odds: unless reinforcements
arrived from Switzerland, Orleans must be
released by composition from Novara. But the
council insisted on an immediate engagement. The
soldiers commonly said that Orleans had promised
Briçonnet an income of 10,000 crowns for his son, if
Milan should still be gained and the siege of Novara
raised. The Swiss did not come; the army was too
small. In September there began to be a serious
talk of peace. On the 26th of that month, Orleans
and his army were released by composition from
Novara. Over 2,000 of them had died of hunger,
and many fell by the roadside from sheer weakness
and died there as they lay. (Commines found fifty of
them dying in a garden, and saved their lives by a
timely mess of pottage.) Most of those who lived to
reach the camp perished of the dangerous abundance.
More than three hundred of their wasted corpses were
cast upon the dunghills of Vercelli.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was a heavy price to pay for one man’s
disobedient ambition. All the harder did it seem to
buy nothing with so great expense. There were
many who were still unwilling for peace. Orleans
had endeared himself to his troops by his conduct
during the hunger of Novara, where he had fared and
fasted like any common man-at-arms, setting aside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>the ducal mess for the use of the sick in hospital.
His mess-fellows were willing still to die for him.
By an ironic turn of fate, on the very day on which
the army evacuated Novara, 20,000 Swiss came to
the relief of the king. With such a reinforcement as
this, cried Orleans, Ligny, D’Amboise and their men,
Charles might not only conquer Milan, but make
himself master of the whole of Italy. But the negotiations
for peace already were begun; Novara was
lost; the French soldiers were few and much enfeebled;
and it was rumoured that the Swiss meant
no less than to capture King Charles with all his
nobles, carry them off into the impregnable fastness
of the Alps, and then exact a fabulous ransom for
their liberty.</p>

<p class='c006'>The King thought it best to dismiss at once these
dangerous allies, and take his homesick soldiers back
to France. On Oct. 10th peace was concluded. The
king promised—on condition that Lodovico Sforza
renounced all claim to Asti, made no obstacle to the
relief of the French in Naples, and paid to Orleans a
war indemnity of 50,000 ducats—not to sustain his
cousin’s right to Milan. Orleans was enraged and
disappointed. In secret he negotiated for the support
of the Swiss captains, and with these and with 800 of
his men-at-arms he meant to march from Vercelli
upon Milan. But the night before he was to leave,
when all was ready, suddenly he demanded the consent
of the King. Charles refused to sanction this
breach of the peace, and bade his cousin join the
army in marching back to France. By Nov. 7th
Orleans, none the richer for his endeavours, was with
the King at Lyons.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>A little more than a year after this the King would
gladly have sent his cousin of Orleans to conquer
Milan: it was the Duke who made excuses and would
not go. For soon after the French returned to
France, the Dauphin died. Charles, who had inherited
that terrible distrust of his own children from
which he had suffered in his father, did not greatly
mourn, or so at least Commines assures us. But if
the quickness of a little child of three—his own son—had
given him concern, much more did he dread his
new heir, the Duke of Orleans. The queen, bewailing
the loss of her child, had fallen into a lamentable
melancholy, and Charles, with an absurd idea of
cheering the poor mother, ordered a masque of
gentlemen to dance before her. Orleans was among
them, and he danced to such purpose, with such
lightness of heart and heel, such buoyancy and gladness,
that the sorrowing queen was seriously offended;
and Charles himself determined, if possible, to send
his cheerful heir a little further from the throne.</p>

<p class='c006'>An opportunity soon offered. Florence, faithful
against all the world to France, sent to the King at
Amboise, asking him to come and uproot the Sforza
out of Milan. She offered to furnish 800 men-at-arms
and 5,000 footmen at her own cost. The
cardinal of St. Peter in Vinculis, the Orsini, Bentivoglio
of Bologna, Este of Ferrara, Gonzaga of
Mantua, all had promised to hire their forces to the
King. Genoa was to be conquered by Trivulzio while
Orleans marched on Milan. The plan of campaign
was settled, the troops were all drawn up, Trivulzio
had already entered Italy with 6,000 infantry and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>800 men-at-arms, when, on the very night of his
departure, Orleans suddenly abandoned his post.
On his own private quarrel, he declared, he could
not and he would not go; as the King’s lieutenant,
and at his express command, he was ready to depart—not
otherwise. “I would never force him to the
wars against his will,” exclaimed Charles, and,
though for many days the Florentine ambassadors
besought him to exercise the authority of the throne,
he refused to interfere with Orleans. “Thus was the
voyage dashed,” relates Commines, “spite of great
charges and all our friends in a readiness. And this
was done to the King’s great grief, for Milan being
once won, Naples would have yielded of itself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>What, then, had happened to change the mind of
Orleans—Orleans, disobedient at Novara, and disobedient
again to-day for so opposite a reason? “He
shunned this enterprise,” continues our historian,
“because he saw the King ill-disposed of his body,
whose heir he should be if he died.” “He would not
go,” relates Guicciardini, “for he saw that the King
was ill, and to himself belonged the succession of the
crown.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Just a year after this, on the morning of Palm
Sunday (April 8, 1498), Louis of Orleans, fallen into
a sort of undetermined half-disgrace, was standing at
a window in his house at Blois, when he saw in the
street some soldiers of the royal guard, running
quickly. “God save the King!” they cried; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Vive le
roi Louis XII.!”</span> This was the first King Louis heard
of the sudden death of his cousin. The day before,
Charles VIII. had fallen down, suddenly stricken to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>death, as he and his wife were watching a game of
tennis from the gallery at Amboise.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>XI.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The French claimant to Milan was now the King
of France. From this moment the pretensions of
Orleans became a factor in European history. The
plans of the first Duke of Milan went so grievously
astray, that, instead of France and Germany each
holding the other in check, for half a century their
armies occupied the soil of Lombardy, nor, when they
withdrew, was the land left at peace, but, baffled and
paralyzed, the helpless prey of Spain.</p>

<p class='c006'>This Iliad is too important to be contained within
the slender limits of an essay. We can but briefly
indicate the events which developed and then extinguished
the right of the French to Milan. Conquered
in 1499, by Louis XII. of France, Lombardy
remained for five and twenty years an intermittent
province of that kingdom, continually revolting, continually
reconquered. During this time several privileges
and investitures, extracted from the Emperor,
confirmed the victories of France, and annulled the
claims of Lodovico Sforza. These investitures are
worthy of at least our brief consideration, since, from
the moment of their bestowal, the French claim to
Milan, already emphasised by the rights of heredity,
testamentary bequest, and contract, received the final
sanction of the feudal law.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first of these Imperial investitures was bestowed
on King Louis XII. by the hand of Maximilian on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>April 7, 1505.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c014'><sup>[103]</sup></a> It secured the Duchy of Milan (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>non
obstante priore investitura illustri Ludovico Sfortia
prius exhibita</em></span>) to the King of France and to his sons;
or, in default of males, to his daughter Claude. At
this time, through the influence of Queen Anne,
Claude was most unnaturally betrothed to the permanent
enemy of her country, the future Charles V.,
and in this document he is mentioned as her husband
and co-heir—a fact he did not allow to slip. But
fortunately the heiress of Brittany, Orleans, and
Milan, was not allowed to marry the great rival of
France. On June 14, 1509, a second investiture
confirmed the inheritance of Claude, and associated
with her therein her future husband, Francis of
Angoulême, her cousin, equally with herself the offspring
of Valentine and Orleans.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c014'><sup>[104]</sup></a> This Imperial
document explicitly admits the right of feminine succession
to a Lombard fief,<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c014'><sup>[105]</sup></a> for Claude, it affirms, is
the heiress to Milan through her father, the grandson
of Madame Valentine. But it says nothing of the
descent of Francis of Angoulême, although it provides
that if Claude should die in childhood, and the
King have no other children born to take her place,
then Francis of Angoulême shall be recognized as in
his own right Duke of Milan because he is the heir of
the King of France.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>These are the rights of Francis I. to Milan, rights
absolute and impregnable. But it was only by continual
conquest that the French could keep their hold
upon the Milanese. For the tendencies of ages go to
show us that there is a natural right more potent than
the claims of blood, succession, testament, adoption,
or investiture. The French dukes of Milan were, in
their own dominions, foreigners. And, as the wise
Commines foresaw—</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is no great seniorie but in the end the
dominion thereof remaineth to the natural countrymen.
And this appeareth by the realm of France,
a great part whereof the Englishmen possessed the
space of four hundred years, and yet now hold they
nothing therein but Calais and two little castles, the
defence whereof costeth them yearly a great sum of
money. And the self-same appeareth also by the
realm of Naples and the Isle of Sicily, and the other
provinces possessed by the French, where now is no
memorial of their being there, save only their ancestors’
graves.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It was the fatal battle of Pavia which really lost
her Italian dependencies to France. The treaty of
Madrid, extorted by compulsion, which proved so
powerless to restore to the Emperor Burgundy (already
become an integral part of France), resigned
to him for ever the dominions of the French in Italy;
not, however, without a struggle. No sooner was
Francis released from Madrid than he declared that
extorted contract void. He despatched protest after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>protest<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c014'><sup>[106]</sup></a> to all the courts in Europe: but what availed
to retain his hold on Cognac, proved vain to regain
him the Milanese.</p>

<p class='c006'>Immediately after the battle of Pavia, Charles V.
had invested Francesco Sforza II., the son of Il Moro,
with the duchy of his fathers. But what should
happen on the death of Francesco Sforza, a childless
man? Foreseeing this event, the hopes of the king
of France were not extinguished; and the ten years
between 1530 and 1540 are filled with the various
endeavours, menaces, persuasions, by which he strove
to obtain from the emperor the Duchy of Milan for
the second son of France. Since it was evidently
impossible to induce Charles V. to let Milan be an
adjunct to the French Crown, the ambition of the
king persevered upon a lower level, and a French
Duke of Milan became the sum of his desires. At
two different moments the realization of this scheme
appeared possible. In 1535, after the death of Francesco
Sforza II., negotiations were set on foot to
obtain the Milanese for Orleans. A document still
existing in the National Library at Paris<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c014'><sup>[107]</sup></a> proves
how lively and how sanguine at this moment was the
hope of Francis I. to recover Milan. The king offered
a promise never to unite this duchy to the Crown of
France, and declared himself ready to expend an
immense sum on its investiture. But the Venetians,<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c014'><sup>[108]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>aware of the danger to themselves which a great
French state must create in Italy, temporized and
manœuvred so well that the matter came to nothing;
for Charles V. was in a humour to credit their assertions,
that any time was better than time present.
The affairs of Italy were dull and dead to him. All
his energies were fixed upon the idea of the crusade
against Algiers. It was proposed that Orleans should
join him in this enterprize,<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c014'><sup>[109]</sup></a> and that, hand to hand
in this holy fight, emperor and prince might consent
to forget the bitter memory of bygone days. But in
1536 the eldest son of Francis died, and Orleans became
the Dauphin of France. The schemes, the
policy which during several years had endeavoured
to secure for the husband of Catherine de’ Medici an
Italian principality, collapsed before that unexpected
stroke of fate. Orleans was not to be the head of an
Italian kingdom reaching from the Alps to Rome, and
in 1540 Charles V. invested his own son, Philip of
Spain, with the Duchy of Milan. Yet France could
not acquiesce in this alienation of her transalpine
inheritance, and in 1544 the disastrous treaty of
Crépy provided that, in two years from that date,
either Milan or the Netherlands should be bestowed
upon the third son of Francis. But before the time
of the engagement had expired, Prince Charles was
dead, and Milan fast in the grasp of the Spaniards.</p>

the fourteenth century, still in many cases preserved their original
idea of military service granted in return for territorial possessions,
a woman could not succeed without direct and especial
mention of this fact in the investiture, or in some subsequent
privilege. But in a purchased fief daughters were admitted to
the succession in default of males. Milan was an imperial fief,
derived directly from the emperor, and held by the peculiar sort

even if not explicitly reserved, for masculine operation only.
Giangaleazzo Visconti paid the enormous price of 100,000 florins
(about £50,000 sterling) for the title and investiture, but I am

The following documents from the Venetian Archives—as yet, I
believe, unpublished—form the natural sequel to this interesting
letter:</p>

<p class='c006'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Senato”</span> I., Reg. 19, fol. 232, under date December 11,
1453.—The Venetians send Venier to ask Savoy to join with
them in requesting the Dauphin to invade Italy: “Venier
must ascertain the views of the Duke of Savoy as to Sforza,
since King René comes into Italy. Let him clearly understand
that Sforza is a most ambitious man, and that if he continue to
prosper as he does he will certainly turn his thoughts towards
Savoy. Venice not only intends to secure her own estate, but
for the sake of her friends and allies will as much and as resolutely
as possible repress the said Count Francesco Sforza, who
may become the Common Enemy. And to this end Venice has
determined to request the aid of France, and among others the
aid of the Dauphin, asking the said Dauphin for the common
good to invade Italy with a force of from 8,000 to 10,000 men.
And we of Venice entreat Savoy to send a suitable ambassador
along with ours to persuade the said Dauphin to this undertaking.
And our intention is to grant the said Dauphin a
suitable subvention in money and whatsoever he may conquer
from Adda to Ticino, and from Padua to Piacenza, except the
domains of Savoy and Montferrat.... Let Venier then discover
how many men and of what sort and when Savoy could
supply to the field....  And if my Lord Dauphin stand out
for the consent of his father, you shall offer on our part to implore
it and procure it for him. And if he wish you to go to the
King you shall go, and, as best you can, procure his consent....
And if the said King or Dauphin say to you this undertaking
regards the Duke of Orleans, say it is true that on the
death of Filippo Maria he sent to us notifying his claims (and
fain would we see a prince of the house of France on the
throne of Milan!), and saying he expected supplies from
France, and we assured him of our delight and pleasure; and
if indeed the King or the Dauphin, at your instance, will supply
the said Lord Duke with an army of from viii. thousand to x.
thousand men, we will aid and assist him upon the same terms
and conditions as my Lord the Dauphin. And go then to the
Duke of Orleans and persuade him to the enterprize.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Reg. 20, fol. 26, July 23, 1454.—This document concerns a
League meant to secure Italian peace by means of an offensive
and defensive alliance, against all breakers of the peace, to be
made between Venice, Milan, Florence, and Naples. Florence
desires an exception in favour of the house of France. At this
Milan, much alarmed, desires Venice by a secret and separate
agreement to sign the First Clause at least with him. Venice
sends ambassadors to Florence and to Milan, pointing out that
the First Clause is absolutely necessary, since, without it, there
is no reason why the King of Arragon should enter the League.
Indeed if an exception be made in favour of France, it will only
and justly irritate him, and thus the alliance would bring rather
discord than peace into the Peninsula. No specific mention
need be made of the house of France, to which Venice entertains
the most friendly feelings. But if the First Clause were
signed and Arragon induced to enter the League Italy might
look forward to many years of peace and tranquillity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reg. 20, fol. 103, October 8, 1456.—The Marquis of Varese,
ambassador to the Duke of Milan, informs the Venetians that
the Doge of Genoa—notwithstanding his open alliance with
France and apparent subjection to her—has made a second and
secret alliance with Arragon and Milan, in which Venice is
prayed to join, against the French. The Venetians reply that,
owing to the mutability and diversity of Genoese affairs, it is
impossible to give any solid advice.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reg. 21, fol. 21, October 10, 1465.—The descendants of
Valentine Visconti—<i>i.e.</i>, the Dukes of Orleans and Brittany and
the Count of Angoulême—sent secret ambassadors to Venice to
treat concerning the recovery of the Duchy of Milan from the
hands of Count Francesco Sforza. Venice replies with compliments,
but expresses herself desirous to keep the peace.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reg. 22, fol. 176, July 28, 1466.—French ambassadors have
been received at Venice from Louis XI., King of France.
Venice assures him of her excellent disposition towards the
new Duke of Milan as well as of her <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“antiqua benivolentia”</span>
towards his father. Venice believes a resumption of the Italian
League is not at that moment necessary, extols King Louis for
his intention to proceed against the Turk, and congratulates him
on the quiet of his realm.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>It is a centre for many memories, this little town of
Rimini, set in the plain by the Adriatic. Here ruled
and ravaged the Mastin Vecchio of Dante. The eyes of
Francesca and her lover remember eternally these
yellow sands. Here Parisina left her innocence.
Here dwelt Gismondo, prince of traitors. And there
are older memories than these. Yet in the city
whence Cæsar crossed the Rubicon, whence Augustus
began the great Flaminian Way, we remember, not
Cæsar or Augustus, but that strange, brave, cruel,
perfidious race of petty despots, whose encroaching
personality and whose genius for architecture has
left an enduring trace on the cities of Romagna.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pesaro, Fano, Cesena, Verruchio, and many another
town owned the unquiet sway of these Malatestas,
and found them a perverse and twisted race,
shot with opposite qualities. They were a race of
wrongheads, as their surname tells us. Criminal
often and yet not merely vicious, having some great
thought in them mostly, some fine intention still
manifest through the error of their lives, many of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>their vices were due to circumstance. A dominant,
courageous race of princelings, mostly illegitimate,
never sure of their tenure, it was only by unquestioned
autocracy and a never-relaxed grasp that they
could secure their state from inner and outer ravage.
Their hand was against every man, and every man’s
against them. Not only the Pope anxious to enlarge
his Venetian frontier, and Venice eager for another
province on the Adriatic seaboard; not only the Duke
of Urbino, the hereditary foe, perched like an eagle
on the hills above, watching the unguarded moment
to pounce upon his prey: not only these, and Sforza
and Arragon, but every brother or cousin of the house,
from his petty stronghold in the plain, was ready to
snatch from the lord of Rimini, his dearly held
supremacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such absolute power in the present, with such
uncertain future, is above all things dangerous to
heady natures. The Malatestas grew mad sometimes
with their unrestrained indulgence, mad with cruelty
and wild debauch; but we repeat they were not merely
vicious. They were strong, cunning, brave unto death,
ambitious; they knew how to make their subjects love
them; they left their little seaside village a monument
of art, and made their few miles of plain a power
in Italy.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1427 there was no lawful heir to this long-enriched
possession. Carlo Malatesta, twice married,
lived in childish state at Rimini: Pandolfo of Fano,
dying in 1427, left no heir from his three brides; but,
in bequeathing to his brother Carlo his estate of Fano,
he also sent to him three natural children, still young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>boys, for whom both uncle and father had in vain
attempted to obtain a bull of legitimation. Powerful
enemies stood in their path. By excluding these
children, Malatesta of Pesaro on the one hand, and
Frederic of Urbino on the other, hoped to succeed to
Rimini and Fano; and for long they persuaded the
Pope to their own interests. But Carlo Malatesta was
not easily thwarted.</p>

<p class='c006'>This Carlo was in many ways the most honourable
of his race; a righteous, moral, pious soldier and
captain, much such another as those who saved
England under Cromwell. It is recorded of him
that, entering Mantua in triumph on the morning of
Virgil’s birthday, he found the great irregular square
there full of revellers, dancing and singing and crowning
with wreaths of flowers the statue of the poet.
Whereat, incensed at such worship paid to a vain
heathen idol, he led up his soldiers to the pedestal
and bade them throw the statue into the Mincio;
which being done, or reported to be done, such a
chorus of blame and indignation rose throughout the
humanistic Hellenist Italy of that day as not one of
the orgies, crimes, brutalities, and lusts of Carlo’s
kinsmen had ever wakened. All this gave little
discomfiture to Carlo, himself in his way a connoisseur
of art and letters, and the first patron of
the young Ghiberti, whom he employed to decorate
the Gattolo at Rimini. Seldom indeed was Rimini
so enviable as during the long and prosperous reign
of Carlo. But in 1429 Carlo died.</p>

<p class='c006'>Just before his death he had procured the legitimation
of his nephews. He was succeeded by Galeotto,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>the eldest, a lad of seventeen, who found a heavy load
in the much-battered helmet and sheath left empty for
him. Many hungry eyes adverse to him were fixed
already on that jacent helm; Frederic of Urbino and
the faithless cousin of Pesaro were ranked close beneath
the city gates; the more ready to snatch his
inheritance because Eugene IV., the newly elected Pope,
discussed with much dislike and doubt the legitimation
granted to Carlo by his predecessor. The Pope, represented
by Urbino, claimed Rimini as devolving to the
See; Sforza and Pesaro, each for himself, were ready
to contest it with him. What chance against such
tremendous odds had Galeotto, seventeen years old,
weak in health, illegitimate, with no great ally to
enforce his claims?</p>

<p class='c006'>A more inadequate champion the mind cannot
imagine. No David eager to fight the giant, this
Galeotto Malatesta, but a wan, emaciated youth,
half-crazed, half-saint. In the middle of the panic,
with the horror of a triple sack maddening the
miserable Riminese, this prince left the city to dwell
in the monastery of Arcangelo, outside the gates.
There he passed his days serene, scathless in the
midst of peril; neither for himself nor his kingdom
taking any thought.</p>

<p class='c006'>So strange this spectacle, so awful, that the very
enemies of Rimini stopped in their onslaught amazed.
The lion, it is said, will not attack a sleeping prey.
Eugene, the Pope (in his temporal character the
deadly foe of Rimini), wrote to its lord, bidding him
remember the imperative duties of his position. The
letter reached that “magnificent man and potent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>prince” in the monastery at Arcangelo, where clad
in the coarse robes of a Franciscan friar, he led an
ascetic, starved, and mutilated life. What was the
magnificence of earth <a id='corr277.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>to him</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_277.3'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>to him</ins></a></span>? So harsh were his self-inflicted
penances that the wounds on his body never
ceased to bleed. What had he to do with rule and
governance? The brothers of the monastery, and
the young virgin wife who drooped and paled at his
side, were all of mankind he knew or saw; and he
himself the chief of sinners. Neither Pope nor
armies could force him back to earth. Thus friends
and foes alike failed to touch him; there was no pity
in the heart of Galeotto the Saint.</p>

<p class='c006'>Or rather—common, yet tragical transmutation of
the Middle Ages—his pity took a retrospective turn;
dead and dry to the present woes it might relieve, it
rushed back in a mighty impotent tide to the foot of
that sacred and awful Cross, whose divine tragedy
was the continual spectacle of the saintly life. Pity
for the dead Christ—throbbing, yearning, helpless, and
indignant pity for the agonized Saviour—this surely
lay at the bottom of all crusades, tortures, persecutions,
inquisitions of the Middle Ages. Living ever
with the crucifix in sight, dwelling ever and solely in
presence of that dread expiation-such fanatics as
Galeotto forgot the example of the life of Christ
in the terror and pity of Golgotha. Vengeance on
the enemies of God! vengeance on the traitors who
still stab and crucify the ever newly sacrificed God
and Victim! so ran the tenor of mediæval piety.
And the contagion of this fanatic sentiment slaughtered
the armies of the East, tossed Albigensian babies on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>to lance-points, and roasted before a ribald soldiery
the pious Vaudois women; the martyrs of Saint Bartholomew
and the martyrs of Smithfield were hewn
and burned by the strength of it; and from its
armoury the Inquisition drew its deadliest weapons.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus Galeotto, unmoved by the misery of the
people who, owing allegiance to him, died, starved,
and sorrowed for his sake, was nevertheless, not without
his private schemes of sanctity and militant
devotion. High thoughts were born in that narrow
mind, as in the intervals of penance and office the
lord of Rimini paced the monastery garden. Monk
as he was by life and feeling, he too had his ambition;
he too had his work to fulfil. And here solved that
the Jews should be cast out from Rimini.</p>

<p class='c006'>Months went on, and the details of his scheme
matured in the brain of the cloistered prince; but,
meanwhile, his foes pressed closer and closer round
him, and there was no leader to lead the few forlorn
troops out to battle; yet ruin stared upon the city
nearer every day, and now or never must the decisive
step be taken. Still Galeotto prayed and dreamed in
his cell at Arcangelo. But an unsuspected deliverer
was in Rimini. One autumn night in 1430, secret to
most of the citizens, a desperate sally was made from
the gates of the town. A short, brisk uncertain conflict
in the terrifying darkness, and the surprised
armies were driven back, ignorant of the small
number of their assailants. And as in the dawn, the
conqueror led his troops back inside the gates, flushed
and triumphant, the people crowded out into the
streets to look at him and bless him, crying that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>great days of Carlo and of Verruchio had returned;
and behold this saviour of the city was the brother
and heir of Galeotto—was the boy Sigismond, or
Gismondo, Malatesta, not yet thirteen years old!</p>

<p class='c006'>Whether the Pope and the oncoming armies perceived
that at last they had a substantive enemy to
deal with, or whether touched with compassion by so
much youthful daring, they concluded a peace with
Rimini only a few days after the successful sally. A
ruinous peace indeed; forfeiting many broad lands
and territories in return for the acknowledgment of
the true right to Rimini, Fano, and Cesena of these
legitimized Malatestas. But the people were thankful
for any peace, and Galeotto easily yielded, seeing here
the needed opportunity to prove his piety. He signed
the treaty on consideration that the Holy Father
would authorize him to expel the Jews from Rimini.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a cruel step. This plain by the Adriatic had
long been a refuge to the outcast nation, who brought
thither their genius for wealth, their industry, and
their abundance. It was represented to Galeotto that
the fortunes of Rimini were bound up with the
presence of these patient and long-enduring exiles.
They had given no cause for just offence; they had,
indeed, offered to defray the heavy amnesty exacted
by the Pope; and to banish them would yet further
enfeeble the war-shattered city. The Pope, indeed,
perceived these thing; but neither gratitude, policy,
nor compassion, weighed with the fanatic Galeotto.
“Better starve,” thought he, “than favour the
enemies of Christ.” So the law went forth, and when
the winter made doubly dreary the wide sandy war-ravaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>plains, a melancholy train of miserable outcasts
set out from the city they had enriched;
banished and ruined for no fault of their own, with
no home before them, and leaving behind them, uprooted
and strengthless as it seemed, the fortunes of
the little town.</p>

<p class='c006'>So the edict ran, and many went out in exile
scarcely was the exodus completed when Galeotto died.
His fasts and scourgings, his long-continued vigils had
worn out his life at twenty years of age. No hermit
of the Thebaid had lived more sparsely or hardly than
this prince of the pagan renaissance. He was borne
to his grave in the monastery churchyard as simply as
any other brother; four monks of the order bore his
bier, holding flaming torches. They laid him to rest
the poor half-mad, self-absorbed visionary. And all
the people mourned him, forgiving his injuries because
he was a saint; and also, it may be, for some endearing
quality in his thwarted nature which does not
reach us across the gulf of years. For his virgin
widow Margaret of Este loved him and mourned him
through all the days of her long life, never marrying
again, and praying on her deathbed to be buried at
his feet; and the city was proud of Galeotto the Saint.
Nevertheless, life appeared more possible now that
he was dead.</p>

<p class='c006'>Galeotto was scarcely buried when new troubles
burst upon the city. Urbino and Pesaro laid siege
to Lungarino, one of the fiefs of the Riminese.
Grief and fear again awoke in the harassed and
impoverished town; but in this trouble Sigismond
saw his opportunity. He had chafed and fumed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>wasted under the regency of the two widows, his
sister-in-law and his aunt. He, a conqueror at
thirteen, was surely at fifteen able to rule a city. A
daring scheme presented itself to the impatient boy;
a scheme which, chance what might, would he knew
but increase his favour with the people, however the
Ladies-Regent might bewail it. He escaped in disguise
from Rimini, and having given notice to his old
adherents, collected them outside the walls, and gaining
new battalions as he marched towards Lungarino,
won a tremendous victory there—a victory which
utterly routed Urbino and Pesaro, and proved Sigismond
Malatesta one of the most valiant champions
in Italy.</p>

<p class='c006'>After this there could be no question of petticoat-government.
At home and abroad this lad of fifteen
had established his right both to govern and to combat.
In this same year (1432) he reconciled Rimini
with the Pope, and concluded an alliance with Venice.
In his new friendship with the great sea-city he
engaged himself to the daughter of Carmagnola,
receiving a portion of the dowry in advance. But
quickly on this betrothal followed the disgrace and
execution of Carmagnola, and it is characteristic of
Gismondo (no less perfidious than brave, grasping
than lavish), that, refusing to ally himself with a
traitor’s daughter, he equally refused to restore her
dowry.</p>

<p class='c006'>A better-omened betrothal, as it seemed, followed
this next year, when Sigismond engaged himself to
Ginevra, the sister of Margaret, his brother’s widow,
and daughter of his friend and ally the powerful Marquis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>of Este. There was high festival both at the
betrothal and the marriage; Sigismund the Emperor
stayed the same year in the town; it was an occasion
of much pageantry. New and better days seemed
dawning on Rimini; and when the Pope gave the
seventeen-year-old Gismondo the command of the
troops of the Church, and restored some of his confiscated
territory, it was evident that good fortune was
secure.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gismondo knew how to be generous and prudent.
Before departing on his campaign he bestowed the
city and lands of Cesena on his brother Domenico,
premising that, in any imminent battle where both
were concerned, Domenico should range himself with
the powers opposed to Gismondo, so that in any case
fortune should not desert the Malatestas. A prudent,
balanced tactic, well worthy of those slow-moving
Condottiere battles, when war was as much a game as
chess, and to keep the rules of the game as important
as to win. Leaving his city, therefore, with a beneficed
protector close at hand, Gismondo set out on his
career as a soldier of fortune.</p>

<p class='c006'>For three years he fought almost <a id='corr282.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='continously'>continuously</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_282.23'><ins class='correction' title='continously'>continuously</ins></a></span>,
gaining great glory for himself in the cause of the
Church, besides in his own cause opposing the Duke
of Urbino. And in 1438, having at last the leisure to
sit at home for a while in peace, he found a new
labour ready to his hand. Built for a palace rather
than as a fort, the Gattolo of the Malatestas offered
them little security in case of war. Gismondo, no
less active as military engineer than as captain or art-patron,
determined to have it down and build in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>stead a Rocca from his own design, to rank among the
strongest in Italy. Calling to his aid Roberto
Valturio, the great military engineer of Romagna,
Sigismond began that famous Rocca of which to-day
only a tower remains, mellowed and faded by the sea
winds of centuries, grown over with lichen and
sprouting wallflowers: only a tower in the sand, disfigured
and insulted by the modern prison built against
it, and of which it forms a part.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the Rocca soon outlived its purpose. By some
strange want of foresight, some hapless piece of
amateurish ignorance, this great pile, the first built in
Italy since the invention of artillery, was planned
with no regard to the changed conditions of warfare.
Not till sixty years after did some wiser engineer
invent the system of bastions; so that, for all its
strength, the mighty Rocca of Sigismond was to some
extent a waste of labour. Yet by the building of it
hangs a tale; through it we approach the greatest
influence of Gismondo’s life; a memory imperishably
united with his own.</p>

<p class='c006'>While the Gattolo, or palace of the Malatestas, was
being levelled to make way for the new fortress, Sigismond
removed his household to the Palazzo Roelli in
the Via Sta. Croce. Besides his servants and his
secretary, he brought with him his miserable wife.
Constantly outraged by his infidelities, Ginevra d’Este
had cause not only for grief, but for fear. One child
had died, and Gismondo had no heir by the woman
whom he had married to unite his still unstable
house with the powerful lords of Ferrara. He chafed
at her presence, useless and undesired.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Close to the Palazzo Roelli stood the Palazzo del
Cimiero, where Francesco degli Atti, a merchant of
noble birth, lived in sufficient state and splendour
with his young son and his motherless daughter Isotta.</p>

<p class='c006'>A strange girl this neighbour of Sigismond’s. Not
beautiful, according to the busts and medals that
record her features—an imperious, resolute, tenacious
creature, imposing her personality like a yoke upon
all who knew her. Hard-featured, long-necked, and
thin, with perhaps in the large eyes burning under
the tense raised eyebrows, a certain feverish, eager
beauty to excuse the general panegyric of her contemporaries.
An expression of patience, of great
constancy, and endurance in the long-lipped, close-shut
mouth, with the strong lines round it, in the long
square of the face, in the beautiful resolute chin.
The face expresses character rather than genius; we
behold in it far-seeing resolve, and patience. The
reputation of great learning remains with Isotta,
despite the modern authorities who, on somewhat insufficient
evidence, assure us that she could not write.
By some means, at all events, by reading and writing,
or by learned conversation and lonely thought, this
Isotta gained an eminence among the women of her
age for learning and talent, for prudence, and the
faculty of government.</p>

<p class='c006'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Fœmina belligera et fortis</em></span>: thus the chronicle of
Rimini describes her. A nature not immoral, but
unscrupulous, a woman in whom will, passion, and
intellect were strong enough each to balance the other.
Isotta gained an influence over the perverse, defiant,
passionate Gismondo which raised her to a position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>in the state far superior to that of the lawful wife; a
position in which the lax morality of her age saw
little disgraceful or revolting.</p>

<p class='c006'>That Isotta felt it there is ample evidence. Taking
Battaglini’s date (1438) as the true commencement of
her relations with Gismondo she must have been
young, certainly under twenty, when she took the first
fatal all-involving step on that road of dishonour she
was so long to tread. Young in age, she was younger
probably by circumstance; this silent, sequestered,
thoughtful girl, with neither mother nor sister to confide
in. Her father raved and stormed, and then forgave
her: I think, remembering a certain beseeching,
miserable, unfortunate letter of hers written fifteen
years later, that she did not forgive herself. Not the
public union of her cipher with Gismondo’s, not the
corps of courtly poetasters occupied in chanting <em>Isottæ</em>
to her glory, not the medals struck in her honour,
nor the eternal monument prepared, could make this
stern proud woman forget that she was her lover’s
mistress only, after all. Nay, would she not silently,
bitterly resent in her inmost heart this blazoning of
her shame? “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Voliatte avere chompasione a mi
poveretta, diate vero spozamento piui presto che viui
posette</span>—Take pity on me, poor me,” she cries;
“give me true marriage as quickly as you can. Ah,
put an end to this thing, which always keeps me enraged.
Sempre me tene arabiatta.” So she cries in
her flat, soft dialect; and must cry long enough, poor
Isotta.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet he was in his fashion faithful to her. He
always returned to her, trusted her, counted on her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>service and her sacrifice. There was none could
govern the city so well in his absence, counsel him,
give up all for him—jewels, safety, honour itself.
And in return he summoned great artists to do her
honour, and instituted the elegiac <em>Isottæ</em>, strained
and fanciful praises, according to the fashion of the
time, of which none are so pregnant, so full of meaning
as those of this fierce, unfaithful, constant-lover
himself. Through the quaint out-dated garb we
catch here and there a glimpse of the man’s own
nature—of his defiant will, his acute and painful
sensibility to beauty, his almost sublime self-preoccupation
and intensity. We discern that he is a
man who ever felt the eyes of posterity upon him,
and yet a fierce, passionate, shameful man; suddenly
falling into crime, sceptical of punishment, yet inherently
superstitious; vibrating through and through
with passion, tainted through and through with
hereditary perfidy; half mad, yet with a touch of
genius and greatness in this chaotic mass of wickedness
and fraud.</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly an end came, for the moment, to this
rhyme-repentance. A fearful crime stopped for a day
or two the verse-making and recitations. On the 8th
of September, 1440, the poor ineffectual Ginevra d’Este
died, having taken (so the rumour went) her fatal
draught of poison from her husband’s hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sigismond was now free to marry a wife who would
bring him legal heirs; Isotta cannot have doubted
that she would be that woman. But Gismondo, the
ardent lover and writer of verses, was not of the
character to throw away so valuable a chance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>alliance. He possessed Isotta already, and she had
no powerful supporters. In 1442 he married Polissena
Sforza, the natural daughter of Francesco Sforza,
that magnificent soldier of fortune, already on the
alert to seize (when death should offer him the chance)
his father-in-law’s rich Duchy of Milan.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chance was to come soon enough; but for a
year or two after Gismondo’s marriage old Visconti
lingered on, and Polissena’s father held his peace.
Meanwhile, war being slack, Gismondo progressed
admirably in his work of remodelling Rimini. In
1446 the Rocca was at length complete; and in the
same year he began a yet bolder and more splendid
undertaking. The old church of San Francesco, a
Gothic building of no great beauty, displeased his
Hellenicized humanistic culture. To him it represented
nothing—that simple Gothic church raised by
the monks to God. Gismondo resolved to convert it
into a temple, a temple still dedicated nominally to
St. Francis, but in reality to become an eternal
monument of Sigismondo and Isotta.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gismondo called to his aid some of the greatest
artists of this time: Matteo da Pasti, the medallist,
to execute the great marble medallions of himself, to
be set up everywhere in the holy place; Ciuffagni for
the statutes (a miserable choice), Simone Ferrucci
for the bas-reliefs of playing children, Agostino
Duccio, that exquisite draughtsman in marble, to
carve in low relief the yellow-white plaques with
allegorical figures, whose flowing lines of floating and
twisted drapery, small well-poised heads, wonderful
grace of attitude, and refined exotic type, recall the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>late Greek bas-reliefs rather than the solid, somewhat
squat forms of Donatello and his school, or the
angular delicacy of Mino. Over all these Gismondo
set Leon Battista Alberti, a man almost as universal
in his attributes as Leonardo himself. Alberti was
to be the architect, and assign with Matteo’s aid
their several parts to each of his co-operators. No
easy task, this of Alberti’s; for Gismondo—with a
flash of the native superstition which shot so
strangely athwart his paganism—refused to destroy
the consecrated walls of the older building. The
architect must build his Hellenic temple on to the
framework of a thirteenth-century Gothic church.
Fortunately, the form of the early edifice, its wide
nave and simple sanctuary not greatly differing from
the Roman Basilica, rendered the conversion within
the limits of possibility, and Alberti appears to have
enjoyed the difficulty of his task. Perhaps he saw in
this endeavour to fuse into one splendid whole the
opposite characters of Gothic mediævalism and Greek
antiquity, the opportunity to immortalize the spirit
of his time—and the result was success. It is built,
this temple of Rimini, of Roman stones from Classis,
antique slabs from Greece, and of the Adriatic clay
fused long ago by pious hands. Augustan arches
rise without, sheltering the sarcophagi of philosophers,
and within, the light from mediæval windows
falls on the altar of a Christian saint. A pagan
church, with pointed Gothic arches raised on sculptured
classic pillars, a splendid anomaly, chiefly
original by its combination of opposing elements, it
is a type of the Italian Renaissance.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Finding it impossible to turn the Gothic front with
its deep porch and rosace to any classical account,
Alberti resolved to inclose it in a marble casing,
distant at all points by nearly four feet from the
original structure. He was now free to plan his
façade, singularly simple in design, yet solemn, beautiful,
and stately in its plainness. From a breast-high
plinth, giving a noble base to the whole structure,
start three engaged arches, the central one larger
than the others and higher in relief; the span of all
three is extremely wide, their proportions being borrowed
from the Roman arch of Augustus close at
hand. At the corners of the façade and on either
side of the central arch stand four fluted columns
with florid capitals; rising from the plinth they
support a heavy, deep-shadowed cornice. Sculptured
votive wreaths, six in all, are hung between
the capitals of the columns and the spandrel of the
arches. From the deep cornice above rises the pediment,
unfinished and irregular, its supporting columns
incomplete. Above this again should have sprung a
cupola, vaulting the entire church in its wide span;
but in its stead a temporary roof still patches the
never-finished masterpiece.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the hollow space between the façade and the old
brick fronting is placed the tomb of Sigismond, accessible
from the interior. But on the lateral fronts
there is no such space, for here the round wide arches
are not merely in relief, but detached: and in the recesses
great stone sarcophagi are placed, standing on
the red-cornered plinth. In these repose the bones
of the humanists and philosophers of Gismondo’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>court. When the temple was built there was made
room for fourteen sarcophagi to stand there to inclose
the most honourable ashes in Italy; but the fate of
incompletion which has overtaken the temple has
not spared this grandiose design. Only seven tombs
stand upon the plinth, seven other empty arches keep
no illustrious dead.</p>

<p class='c006'>Passing through the low door under the central
arch of the façade we are amazed by the rich and
strange impression of the interior—doubly impressive
after the severity outside. The nave is furnished with
eight side chapels inclosed by a high balustrade;
there are four on each side, the two central ones
being in double bays, while a considerable wall space
divides the first and last on either side from these.
The wall between the arches, divided by slender
columns, is tinted alternately with pale sea-green and
the lightest red; the frieze bears the same tints;
across it are swung heavy festoons of yellow-white
marble. The sculptured pillars and railings of the
chapels are also tinted with like delicate colours.
Ferrucci’s bas-reliefs of playing children stand out
against a ground of palest, unglazed, greenish-blue,
and below these the balustrade is simply white, while
beneath Agostino’s delicate untinted low-reliefs the
railing is of the richest deep-red breccia, elaborately
sculptured with double-headed elephants. Behind
Ciuffagni’s rude figures the background is of dull
gold, while here and there on all sides a tinge of gold
faintly lines and splashes the yellowish marble. On
the frieze, on the shields of the putti, over the doorways,
on the columns and the tombs, above the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>heads of the saints in their chapels, we find the
double cipher of Sigismond and his mistress. The
saints themselves are not safe. Isotta wears the
robes and wings of St. Michael. Over the chapel
balustrades flourishes her rose, and the image of
Sigismond is carved upon the pillars. So that from
pedestal to cornice the whole great church is one
memorial of the passion that defied it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many great artists worked to complete the beauty
of Sigismond’s temple; but until quite lately the
name of the sculptor of the most perfect of these
panels was undetermined.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c014'><sup>[110]</sup></a> M. Yriarte has told us
that we owe them to a certain Florentine cutpurse,
Agostino di Duccio. The fact is patent. Never
having read M. Yriarte’s learned and precious
volume, I came to Rimini straight from Perugia,
straight from Duccio’s wonderful façade of San
Bernardino. That façade, those figures so admirable
in their poise, that sweeping drapery full of
intricate line and harmony, those heads, small, and
graceful, with the exotic beauty and rapture of expression,
had produced on me the strongest, the most
durable impression. A few days after, finding in the
decorations of two chapels at Rimini the same strange
poetic grace, the same exquisite attitude, the same
wavy lines, low relief, and classic feeling, I could not
but recognize the master. And so, no doubt, has
many another chance traveller, such as I, lacking
authority without M. Yriarte and his documents—though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>without documents the fact itself is surely
clear. For the existence of two monuments so
strikingly original and singularly alike as the San
Bernardino of Perugia and the Cappella di San Gaudenzio
at Rimini must surely be due to one hand.
The very details of the ornament, the characteristic
round sweeps of drapery, like a wind-blown scarf;
the exceeding lowness of relief, almost as if drawn on
the stone; the type of head, with inspired glance
and lips frequently apart are all the graces—the
mannerisms even—of one master. That master one
would, from the strange beauty of expression in these
figures, have judged to be a Sienese, were not the
authorship of San Bernardino graven across its front:
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Opus Augustini Florentini Lapicidæ, MCCCCLXI</span>. It
is difficult to imagine how a Florentine, a pupil of
Donatello’s, could acquire that tall and ripely-slender
severity of form, that exquisite freedom of hand; nor
does he take his style from the school of the Robbias.
In its distinguishing characteristics his manner is
unlike any of the great Italian masters. By a bold
hypothesis we might account for it with satisfaction
by supposing that among those many slabs and lids
of marble which Gismondo brought from Greece for
the building of the temple there may have been some
precious fragment of classic bas-relief not overlooked
by the keen-eyed cutpurse and sculptor; who thence-forwards
proved himself a master among the masters
of his day, first at Rimini and later at Perugia.</p>

<p class='c006'>The subjects of these designs of Duccio’s have
troubled many generations. In the chapel of the
Holy Sacrament, the planets, the twelve signs of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Zodiac, and a series of animals magnificently treated,
form the decoration. In the Chapel of San Gaudenzio,
the subjects are the Muses, Virtues, and other allegorical
figures. M. Yriarte has proved that this
strange assemblage illustrates a long passage in one
of Gismondo’s poems to Isotta; and it appears likely
that Alberti, himself an author, gave the passage to
Duccio for a text. Of a series of thirty-six exquisite
bas-reliefs it is impossible to give much description
here; but I would advise all lovers of Renaissance
sculpture to procure, at least, Alinari’s photographs
of the <em>Diana</em>, the <em>Agriculture</em>, the <em>Medicine</em>, the
<em>Botany</em>, and the <em>Poetry</em> from Rimini, and to compare
these with the exquisite designs of a woman catching
together at the knees the folds of her wind-blown
mantle, from the façade of San Bernardino.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sigismond compelled haste from the artists who
served him. This temple, of which the corner-stone
was laid in 1446, was, by his most earnest desire, to
be fit for service and consecration in 1450, the great
Jubilee year at Rome. And this in fact was done;
the dome was not yet planned, and a flat wooden roof
crowned the building; the transept was scarce begun;
the façade broken off almost at the base of the pediment;
but the nave with its bays was finished, a
wonder of sculpture and colour. And as it was
opened in 1450 so we behold it to-day.</p>

<p class='c006'>A strange ceremony it must have been, that Jubilee
service in the newly-opened temple. The prelates
and great dignitaries of the church meet, appalled,
in that splendid shrine to Diva Isotta, which a little
later the Pope should adduce as absolute and sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>proof of the paganism of its founder. From
door to transept, from pedestal to cornice, no memento
of Christ; only everywhere the I.S. of Isotta
and her lover mocking the sacred <a id='corr294.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='mongram'>monogram</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_294.4'><ins class='correction' title='mongram'>monogram</ins></a></span>; and the
rose of the prince’s mistress where there should have
been the crown of thorns. Diva Isotta herself would
be there in all her glory; she had furnished from her
private purse the funds for her chapel of St. Michael,
where her likeness filled the robes of the saint, where,
shadowed with the blazons of Sigismond and standing
on the Malatestan elephants, her sarcophagus stood
ready. There, also, must have been the hapless
Polissena, condemned to witness this triumph of her
rival, condemned to praise the chapel in Isotta’s
honour, while seeing nowhere in all that splendid
church a corner dedicated to herself, nor any memorial
of the dead Ginevra.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hapless Polissena! Even then her husband was
treating with the Pope to legitimize his children by
Isotta. She had no children. Even before that
ominous festival her husband had made the war of
succession at Milan against her father. Her claims
on him were breaking, one by one. And when the
peace was made, and the Pope gave Sigismond, with
Sinigaglia, the legitimation of his children, she must
have thought bitterly of Ginevra’s end. Indeed a few
weeks afterwards she too died suddenly, terribly. Not
poison this time, the rumour went. Gismondo, they
said, had strangled her with a napkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>None dared accuse him then. He was at the
height of his power and formidable triumph—at the
summit, the climax, beyond which is no ascent. Yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>even then he had made a deadly enemy, scorned at
present, but who knew how to wait. Not Sforza, who
seems to have taken the loss of his daughter with
strange indifference. It was the perfidy and not the
violence of Sigismond that wrought his ruin. Engaged
to fight for Arragon in the war of the Milanese
succession, he had received in advance a large portion
of his pay. Then the Florentines sought to tempt
him from his allegiance. With true Tuscan shrewdness
they chose for their agent no Medici, no
magnificent money-bag or puissant general—but
Gianozzo Manetti the Humanist. Him and his rare
manuscripts they send into Gismondo’s camp; and
as the scholar treats with the great captain, he shows
him such-and-such a precious Greek fragment, or a
perfect copy of Virgil—or the Platonists, pointing
without too obvious intention the superior culture of
Florence to barbarous Arragon. Gismondo, fascinated,
stepped into the snare. The next day he deserted to
Florence, refusing, moreover, to restore the immense
wage he had drawn from the Duke of Arragon for
services never to be rendered. Nor at the time was
there any redress for that prince; but the time of
vengeance was to come.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile, incautious, believing that he could
compass heaven and earth between his courage and
his perfidy, Sigismond earned yet more of the traitor’s
wages. Scarcely was the peace of Lodi signed (in
1454), than he hired himself and his troops to the
Republic of Siena in their quarrel against the lord of
Pittigliano. Again he deserted to the enemy, thinking
to make a better bargain with him. The Sienese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>sent him his demission, “in terms of great courtesy
and haughtiness,” but denounced his treachery to all
the great powers with which they were allied, including
Arragon. He, perceiving in this double proof of
treachery, sufficient cause for a quarrel, sent Piccinino,
the greatest soldier of fortune of his day, against
the wall of Rimini. Yet all was not lost; for Sforza
came to the aid of his son-in-law. Had Sigismond
stuck to his sword all might have gone well; but of
late he had become perilously adept in the traitor’s
cunning trade. He despatched a secret message to
René, king of Anjou, offering—in return for present
help—to invade the kingdom of Naples, oust Alfonso
of Arragon and restore it to the Angevines. René
accepted, and landed at Genoa, but only in time to
learn the sudden death of Alfonso. Sforza, learning
all the details of the scheme, withdrew his forces from
Rimini, alienated once and for ever from the traitor
who would call the French to settle his quarrels; for
Sforza, as we know, had reasons for wishing the
kinsman of Charles of Orleans well on the other side
the Alps. At this moment the succession of a
Sienese, Æneas-Sylvius Piccolomini, to the papal
throne under the title of Pius II., left Gismondo
without a friend in Italy, five years after his triumphs
in war and in peace of the glorious year 1450.</p>

<p class='c006'>Little time now for temple-building. Gismondo,
before Siena, had amused himself with drawing out
plans for the dome in intervals of battles and traitorous
despatches. He now found enough to do in
keeping Piccinino at bay. The Angevines were of no
service; they had but estranged the sympathies of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Italy from his cause. He tried even, it is said, to
tempt the universal enemy of Christendom, the
Grand Turk himself, to espouse his cause. There is
no knowing to what lengths he would not go in his
lonely, impotent, swift despair, and defiant ruin; and
it is possible that he may have remembered the
examples of Carlo Zeno and the great Visconti. One
good and wise thing, at least, Gismondo did in these
terrible years of friendless battle. He married the
faithful Isotta, who proved herself a right valiant
defender and regent of his city.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile the Pope had enrolled himself among
the active enemies of Sigismond. Siena was avenged.
Amid great state and ceremony the effigy of Gismondo
Malatesta was burned in the streets of Rome; interdict
and excommunication were pronounced against him.
Parricide, murderer of old men and innocent women,
committer of adultery and incest, prince of traitors,
enemy of God and man: so ran the terms of this
tremendous accusation. But the Pope was not contented
merely to accuse. He threatened not only
Gismondo with his anathema, but whatsoever nation
or army should arise to help him. Having thus
disabled his enemy, he sent his forces against Rimini.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sigismond, maddened and desperate, looked vainly
round for an ally. Siena, Arragon, Florence, Milan,
all were hostile, or at best neutral. Yet help must
be found. Almost alone, facing a hundred perils,
Gismondo trudged across the Apennines to the kingdom
of Naples in search of his fatal friends the Angevines.
But from them he got no help, not a promise
even. Back to Rimini, desperate, baited, hurried the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>miserable Sigismond. Finding the towns still held
out, he took to the sea, and went to Venice—praying
in his abject extremity for succour, for protection.
And the Venetians, bound to him by old ties, did
indeed afford him a slender assistance. By the aid
of this he escaped death and flagrant ruin. The
Pope made peace with him, though only on condition
that he and his brother Domenico should make
public penance for their misdeeds at Rome, resigning
all their possessions save their capitals and a few
castles, which also must devolve to the Holy See after
the deaths of their present lords. And to these terms
he consented. Nothing but his sword and his city
were now left to the once triumphant Sigismond.
Leaving Rimini to the staunch Isotta—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>fœmina belligera
et fortis</em></span>—he hired himself to the Venetians, to
conduct their forces against the Turks in the Morea.
Here a faint shadow of his former glory played for a
while around him; and in 1465 Gismondo returned
to Rimini, enriched, and bringing with him as his
dearest possession the bones of Gemisthus Pletho, the
Platonist, to place in the first sarcophagus of the
temple.</p>

<p class='c006'>Within the year Pius II. died, and Paul II. reigned
in the Vatican. The new pontiff called Sigismond to
Rome, and there concluded with him what seemed a
most favourable treaty. But Gismondo was no sooner
back in Rimini than the Pope, jealous of Venice,
proposed to him to cede his city to Rome, in exchange
for Spoleto and Foligno. When Sigismond comprehended
this proposal a veritable madness seemed to
seize him. Resign Rimini, the city he had saved at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>thirteen, had fought for ever since, had spent his
whole life and fortune in embellishing! He and
Isotta and his sons go into exile in the marshes of
Foligno! Rimini, with the Rocca and temple of his
building, with the tombs of centuries of ancestors—Rimini,
with its salts and its seaboards—yield <em>that</em>?
Sigismond sent no answer to the Pope; but mad, in
a burning fever, he journeyed by day and night to
Rome. His attendants noticed that he never slept,
that he clutched under his coat a dagger, never relaxed.
Arrived at Rome, he went instantly to the
Vatican, demanding a private audience; but the Pope,
warned, it may be, appointed a meeting for the morrow.
Then he received the lord of Rimini, guarded
by a great concourse of princes and cardinals. Sigismond
had not foreseen such a reception. Gazing
wildly, and clutching still the ineffectual hidden dagger
which he could not use, he made what terms he could,
since revenge was impossible. The right to remain in
Rimini was finally conceded him, but under the pretext
of a captainship of troops the Pope kept him far
from home, employed in petty guerilla warfare. A
year later the fever had gained a fearful hold upon
him. He dragged himself back to Rimini, to Isotta.
Impoverished, friendless, powerless, the city was at
least his own to die in. His last thoughts were for
Isotta and her children, left friendless in an unkind
world. Thus he died, the great Malatesta.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Galeazzo Maria, Duke of Milan, was murdered
in church at Christmas by a band of heroes,
his brothers, the Duke of Bari and Lodovico il Moro,
were absent on an embassy in France. The head of
affairs was Cecco Simonetta, since many years the
secretary and minister, first of Count Francesco, and
later of his son. Having lived so long in the family,
Simonetta was aware how much his dead master’s
children had to fear from their uncles. With one
stroke of the pen he banished the Duke of Bari and
Lodovico il Moro.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was in 1476. For three years all went well in
Milan. Simonetta had so long guided the course of
affairs that the death of the Duke made little difference
to the external policy of the state. Galeazzo
Maria had called himself a Ghibelline, Cecco
Simonetta dared at last to avow himself a Guelf;
but under one as under the other, the course of Milan
continued Liberal and French. Inside the city there
were a few less murders,—less ominous stories than
were told in the lifetime of the handsome, cruel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>dilettante Duke. His widow, the Duchesse Bonne,
had the wardship of her children, and lived a pleasant
life in her beautiful palace, where Commines remembered
to have seen her in great authority. She had
two little boys and a girl; she had excellent counsellors,
a court full of admirers, beautiful clothes, and
a devoted lover.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet the Duchess was not satisfied. Bonne de
Savoie was an empty pate, vain and restless, as was
the temper of her house. There was in the palace a
young man who carved before her at table, Antonio
Tassino, an adventurer from Ferrara, “of very mean
parentage,” not handsome, but with a certain grace
and air in the way he wore his cloak. This was the
Duchess’s lover, and there was no matter of state
(says Corio) but she consulted her carver before she
allowed it to pass. It is not surprising that
Simonetta—an old statesman, tenacious of dignity, in
spite of his Liberalism, was scandalized at the importance
of Tassino. It is equally easy to imagine how
the successful Ferrarese was irritated by the disdain
of Simonetta. So it fell out; and rather out of spite
than from conviction, Tassino constituted himself the
chief of the Ghibellines in Milan, merely intending to
procure the fall of Simonetta. So great was his
influence over the Duchess, that he persuaded her at
last to privily recall her husband’s brother, Il Moro—a
Sforza, and therefore presumably a Ghibelline—who
was at that moment engaged in the war at Genoa.</p>

<p class='c006'>All that follows sound like a passage in some
ancient novel of adventure. The Duchess sends to
Genoa to Il Moro, who, coming at night to Milan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>is secretly admitted by the Duchess and her lover
through the garden gate of the palace. Lodovico
returns not alone; Bari is dead but, in place of
the lost brother, Roberto di Sanseverino a great
captain, dare-devil, incorrigible, comes at his heels:
a man whom Simonetta had exiled with the sons of
Francesco Sforza, a Ghibelline <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>à l’outrance</em></span>, a personal
enemy of Cecco. These were the men whom
Bonne, weary of her ancient counsellor’s respectability,
called home, “through great simplicity,”
as Commines declares, “supposing they would do the
said Cecco no harm, and the truth is that so they had
both of them sworn and promised.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When Sanseverino and Il Moro were safe in the
palace, the Duchess sent for Simonetta and told him
all she had done. She must have been alarmed to
see the horror and consternation on the faithful
secretary.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c014'><sup>[111]</sup></a> <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“Duchessa Illustrissima,”</span> said the man,
with the quiet of despair, “he will cut off my head,
that is all; a little time more and he will send you
packing!” The Duchess probably remembered these
words when, the third day after their return, Il Moro
and Sanseverino caused the man who had signed
their exile to be carried through the streets of Milan
in a wine barrel, and then—still in this ridiculous
tumbril—taken to the fortress at Pavia. There was
Simonetta imprisoned; but once inside the gates his
lot appeared to mend. Lodovico il Moro frequently
rode across to Pavia to take counsel with the wise old
<a id='corr302.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='statesmen'>statesman</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_302.30'><ins class='correction' title='statesmen'>statesman</ins></a></span> and learn his views of the world. He went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>indeed so often that the people of Milan began to
murmur and to say that Lodovico, recalled by a
Ghibelline <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>coup d’étât</em></span>, was a Guelf in disguise. To
reassure them on that head, in the month of October,
1480, Lodovico intimated to Simonetta—not without
many apologies—that, in deference to popular prejudice,
he must even consent to lose his head. And in
that very month, the first part of the secretary’s prophecy
came true.</p>

<p class='c006'>The second half was for a while delayed. Duchess
Bonne found no reason to regret the step which had
relieved her of an inconvenient old servant. “They
used the lady very honourably in her judgment,
seeking to content her humour in all things,” said
Commines, who knew them all.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But all matters of importance they two despatched
alone, making her privy but to what pleased them;
and no greater pleasure could they do her than to
communicate nothing with her. For they permitted
her to give this Anthony Tassino what she would;
they lodged him hard by her chamber; he carried
her on horseback behind him in the town; and in
her house was nothing but feasting and dancing.”
The Duchess had never led a happier life; but all
that jollity endured but half a year. One day Lodovico
took out his little nephews to walk in Milan; children
are ever interested in things of warfare; he took
them to the Rocca—the impregnable fortress—he
took them inside; he did not bring them home.</p>

<p class='c006'>English readers know what to expect when an
ambitious uncle, in the Middle Ages, leaves two little
Princes in the Tower. But no midnight assassin cut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>short the days of Giangaleazzo and his brother Ermes.
They were more useful to their uncle, living—at least
until he had made his own position surer: for at
present he only ruled in Milan as Tutor and Regent
of the little Duke. But, by whatever title, he ruled
effectually, and soon he rid his palace of the tearful
and frivolous presence of Madame Bonne, whom he
exiled from her duchy “for immorality,” and who
carried her inept remonstrances and her tarnished
honour to find a none too chivalrous asylum at the
court of her brother-in-law, Louis XI. of France, a
man impatient of unsuccessful women.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile Lodovico il Moro flourished in Milan.
Under his cultured and dignified rule it became a
magical city, a capital of masterpieces. There in
1483, Leonardo da Vinci took up his abode, cast his
bronze statue of Francesco Sforza, painted pictures,
and founded a school of Lombard painters, little less
exquisite, mysterious, and sensual than himself. The
Choir of Singers, whom Galeazzo Maria Sforza had
brought across the Alps, increased, and the singing
and playing of Milan became a thing of note.
Temples and palaces sprang up as by enchantment;
and learned humanists—grave Romans, bearded
Greeks, astute Orientals—from all the centres of
knowledge in the world, came to lecture on law,
science, and the classics, in brilliant Milan. Nor
was the Court of Venus, says Corio, less distinguished
than the Court of Minerva. “All were
willing to concede their best and fairest to the Court of
Cupid; fathers their daughters, husbands their wives,
brothers their sisters.” And the laxity of Lombard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>manners which had scandalized the very Court of
Lorenzo de’ Medici, in 1471, was not less abandoned,
not less luxurious, although more natural and freer
from cruelty under the sceptre of the Regent Lodovico
who appears at the head of this princely retinue, a
man majestic, suave, omniscient, as any Duke of
Shakespeare’s plays.</p>

<p class='c006'>And yet the real Duke was seldom seen, seldom
heard. It was polite to suppose him still a child.
None the less every one knew he had been born in
the year 1469, amid incredible rejoicings; and many
had seen the great Lorenzo de’ Medici when he came
to the christening, and had looked on the magnificent
necklace of diamonds which he had given the Duchess.
“Ah, you shall be godfather to all my children!” the
Duke Galeazzo Maria had cried with cordial <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>naïveté</em></span>.
And now—ah, Time’s revenges!—the Duke was
murdered, the Duchess in exile, and the babe whom
all men had welcomed—a prisoner rather than a ward
in the hands of the ambitious Regent!</p>

<p class='c006'>Men began to murmur, and when Giangaleazzo was
about eighteen his uncle found himself unable any
longer to defer his marriage. Years ago the child
had been betrothed to Isabel of Arragon, the granddaughter
of the King of Naples. She came to Milan
in 1487. A little later Lodovico himself married a
young wife, Beatrice, daughter of Ercole d’Este, Duke
of Ferrara.</p>

<p class='c006'>So long as there had been no woman at the head of
the Court of Milan, there had been no discord. The
young Duke, half a captive, had a doglike docile affection
for his tyrant; he was content to yield his place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>and keep his title; and Lodovico was satisfied to
have the place without the name. But Isabel of
Arragon was a Neapolitan and a Spaniard—a nature
passionate, arrogant, intense. In vain she urged her
husband to assert his rights. He promised what she
would, and then confessed their conversation to his
uncle. When her child was born, and still the bride
of Lodovico sat on the throne which should have
been her throne—Isabel would no longer possess her
soul in patience. This time she did not appeal to her
husband—a beautiful youth, soft as silk, innocent as
flowers, incapable of revenge or determination; she
wrote to her father and her grandfather at Naples,
men as different from him as men can be. She asserted
her rights (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“essendo giovane di grand’ animo”</span>);
she told them of the intolerable yoke of Lodovico—of
her husband, a grown man and a father, yet kept in
tutelage. She told them doubtless by her messenger
(no word of personal complaint appears in her letter)
what Corio tells us: that amid all the luxury of
Milan, the Duke and the Duchess procured with difficulty
the bare necessities of life. There was much
indignation in her old home, and Alfonso wrote to Il
Moro demanding the throne and government of Milan
for his son-in-law. “You make a laughing-stock of
my daughter—shall we endure to see our blood
despised?”<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c014'><sup>[112]</sup></a> Lodovico, as his manner was, returned
a soft answer. And a year or two went by in procrastination
and recrimination; but in 1493 the house of
Naples, in defence of the young Duke, declared war
upon the Regent of Milan.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>In another place I have spoken of the dismay and
terror of that hour; the still rage of Lodovico—a
rage not unmixed with joy and with the presentiment of
success; the anger of his young wife, determined not
to quit her throne, determined to take at last from the
detested Isabel that one fine thing which as yet she
had not dared to take from her: the title of Duchess.
My readers know how, on the one hand, Lodovico
sent to the Emperor admitting the illegal nature of
the Sforza claim, and entreating him (for a consideration)
to bestow it on him anew; how, on the
other hand, he sent into France reminding Charles
VIII. of the French claim to Naples; and how the
French crossed the Alps in September; and how, in
September also, very secretly, the Emperor’s Investiture
arrived in Milan; and how on the morrow
after the French left Milan the young Duke died
(Teodoro di Pavia discovering in his body the evident
signs of poison); and how the people, overawed by the
neighbourhood of the French, were taught to acclaim
Lodovico, consecrated thus alike by Imperial privilege
and popular voice; so that he ruled at last as Duke
in Milan.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile Isabel and her little son had wandered
about in exile, vainly seeking supporters. Success
smiled on her rival, Beatrice, the mother of two sons
who each, after many adventures, should rule as
Duke of Milan. In September, 1496, while Isabel,
her child in her arms, was discovering the futility of
resistance, Beatrice at Vigevano was entertaining
Maximilian. The great Emperor was at that time a
man of thirty-seven, with long whitening hair, dressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>in a long black velvet coat, a black woollen French cap,
black stockings and sleeves; he wore no ornament save
a little gold chain with the order of the Golden Fleece.
He was under a vow to wear nothing but black until he
could boast a Turkish victory. But, melancholy and
grizzled Don Quixote as he appeared, Maximilian
was no less an Emperor; and the Diary of Marino
Sanuto shows us the splendour with which the Duke
and Duchess of Milan made him welcome.</p>

<p class='c006'>That splendour was very costly. Not only did it
compel the Duke to levy grievous taxes (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>grandissime
exstrusione a li so populi</em></span>) on his subjects, so that they
were like desperate men, desiring any change. If the
expense of this entertainment was paid in tears, no
less a price should be exacted for its fatigue. In
September the Duchess Beatrice was pregnant:
Marino Sanuto will conclude the story.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c014'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<div class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>“News of the month of January, 1496 (Old Style).</div>

<p class='c006'>“How at Milan, in the castle, on the third day of the
month, the Duchess, wife of the reigning Duke
Lodovico, Beatrice by name, daughter of the Duke of
Ferrara, was delivered of a still-born son; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>etiam</em></span> she
herself was dead five hours after the child. And the
said death hath plunged the Duke in heavy
sorrow, so that he keepeth his room, the shutters
closed and candles lit in daytime. And ’tis also reported—as
I saw it set down in another letter—that
the said Duchess died on the second day of the month,
at six o’clock after noon; and that very day she had
gone riding in her carriage through the streets of
Milan, and had held a ball at the castle until two o’clock
after dinner. And she hath left only two children
behind her, boys—the one, Maximilian, Count of
Pavey; the other, Sforza, three years of age. And
the Duke cannot suffer the sorrow of this loss, for the
great love he bore to his wife; and he saith he hath
no heart for his children, nor his State nor for aught
under the sun; so that almost is he weary of his <a id='corr309.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='life'>life.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_309.21'><ins class='correction' title='life'>life.</ins></a></span>
And, out of sadness, he keepeth his chamber, which
is hung all in black; and there for a fortnight he
hath shut himself in. And ’tis said that, in the selfsame
night the Duchess died, the walls of her garden
fell crashing to the ground, and yet was there neither
tempest, wind nor earthquake; which thing was held
by many for a sign of very evil omen.”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c006'>Last year I was in Lombardy, and, as a faithful
adherent of the Viscontis, I stayed a little in Pavia.
I found it a rather gloomy little Lombard town, white-washed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>and paven. Here and there a wine-coloured
wall or tower broke the pallid monotony of the streets.
The famous fortress, where Isabel of Arragon eat her
heart in bitterness so many years, still exists, much
rebuilt and altered indeed, but always a mass of fine
red colour. In Pavia, however, there was nothing so
interesting to me as those phantoms of vanished Viscontis
and long-supplanted Sforzas that seemed so
strangely out of place in this sad little sordid university
town. And among these ranks of tragic
shadows, the least forgiven, the least beloved, was
always the Duchess Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c006'>I had known her too long, the youthful and charming
Lady Macbeth of Lombardy. I knew her as well
as one can know a person, familiar through the gossip
of acquaintance, although unseen and distant. I had
heard of her as a haughty and ambitious woman,
accepting with a smile the crimes that placed the
crown of Milan on her head. She appeared as some
Herodias of Luini’s, exquisite and sinister. And yet I
knew she had been dearly worshipped in her lifetime
and long lamented in her tomb. There are such
Sirens, heartless and chill themselves, but capable of
seizing an honest love with the same hands that grasp
at a blood-stained treasure. Such, in my eyes, was the
adored and evil wife of Lodovico il Moro.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was Christmas-time and cold; with difficulty I
roused myself to visit the Certosa. It is six miles, I
suppose, from Pavia. The wretched carriage slowly
dragged along through the muddy country; and from
the whitened window one felt rather than saw the
immense desolation of the view. On either hand of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>raised road, a sluggish canal, and beyond a monotonous
landscape of brown marshy pastures and bright
green rice fields flecked with water, across which the
scant snow drifted. The road seemed to extend for
ever in front, unbroken, unturning. Suddenly in the
middle of the country the carriage stopped; I
walked a few steps up a muddy lane. To the right
over a wall there appeared a great dome, with
rose-red minarets, with spires of pale red, ivory and
marble, among innumerable shaft-like towers tipped
with cream-white columns. It is the Certosa.</p>

<p class='c006'>At another season and in better health I should
have found much to linger over in the great façade of
the Certosa, fantastic, incoherent as a Midsummer
Night’s Dream. Every inch of the front is covered
thickly with ornament in high relief—Roman emperors
and paladins of chivalry, eagles with praying angels
on their outspread pinions, exquisite maidens floating
full-length on a dolphin’s back, Sirens suckling their
unearthly babes, hippogriffs, Prophets of Israel:
strange, unexpected as the visions of delirium, they
are assembled there. But, alone, in the bitter wind,
I glanced at it all for a moment and entered the vast
foundation of Giangaleazzo Visconti. Great halls,
enormous, cold, spoiled as much as may be by the
seventeenth century; a few good pictures by
Borgognone, many bad ones; posthumous portraits
of the great Viscontis: it was not so interesting as I
had supposed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Still I wandered on, making reflections on the
difference of type in the Sforza and Visconti heads:
the older tyrants keen-faced, refined with delicate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>bone-less oval faces, and thin firm lips ridged out in
a narrow line. There is something wolf-like in the
long pointed noses, the pointed chins, low foreheads,
as well as in the keen eyes, narrow and high in
the head; altogether an interesting type, subtle,
cruel, intellectual, and fierce. The Sforzas with their
Wellington noses, their strongly marked eyebrows,
prim-pursed lips and rounded chins, seem a square-faced
kindly race of captains. Lodovico il Moro himself
is there, with the fat face and fine chin of the elderly
Napoleon, the delicate beak-like nose of Wellington;
a small querulous neat-lipped mouth, and immense
eyebrows, stretched like the talons of an eagle across
the low forehead, complete the odd, refined physiognomy
of the man. I looked at him with interest
for a moment. But there, straight before me, stood
the tomb of the wife he lost so young, the Duchess
Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c006'>To think that she is dead, and to think she was a
woman! Impossible. She is a lively child, fallen
asleep in playtime: motionless, but full of a contained
vivacity. Her tumbled curls hang loosely
round her shoulders, and stand up in a little frizz
above the rounded childish forehead. As she lies
there, a look of infantine candour is diffused over the
soft, adorable, irregular features. She has straight,
brief eyebrows like a little girl, but her closed
eyelids are rounded like the petals of a thick white
flower, and richly fringed with lashes. The little nose
is of no particular shape—not quite a straight nose,
but certainly not a snub; it is the prettiest nose at
Court, with a rounded end like a child’s. The cheeks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>too, are round apple-cheeks, not in the least like the
Herodias of Luini; and round is the neat bewitching
chin. But her chief beauty is her mouth—a mouth
with the soft-closed lips of a dear child pretending to
be asleep, yet smiling as if to say, “Soon I shall jump
up and throw my arms round your neck, and you will
be so surprised!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The round head rises from a long plump throat.
The small figure too is slender and plump at once, and
very small, full of life still, it seems, under the pretty
tight silk dress, with the slashed and purfled sleeves,
and the long train of brocade, so lovingly, so carefully
arranged not to encumber nor hide those little
pattened feet, that were so fain of dancing and seem
so ready to awake and dance again. This, then, is
the famous Beatrice!—I looked and looked, at last I
understood not only her, but the love of Lodovico:
“And so, dear child, thou canst not live without a
crown?—Ah well! What shouldst thou know of
murder, dishonour, and the ruin of great states?
Thou wilt never understand these gloomy things, and
I shall pay the price—Ah God in heaven, I thank
Thee for the gift of an immortal soul, since I may
lose it for the pleasure of this child!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps it was in this way that Lodovico reasoned;
or perhaps it may be that at heart Macbeth is no less
ambitious than his wife. Who knows? The wife,
at least, must stand for something. At least, some
share in the ruin of their country must be accorded
to these three women—Bonne, who recalled Lodovico
to Milan; Isabel, who inspired the war of Arragon and
Sforza; and Beatrice, whose ambition urged her
husband to invite the French to Italy.</p>

<p class='c006'>When, in the October of 1494, the King of France
marched south from Asti, a torpor of stupefaction fell
upon the princes of Italy. For the last three years
there was no one of them but had coquetted more or
less with France; there was no one of them but was
the enemy of that arrogant house of Arragon which
had lost Scutari to Venice, and which had dared
reprove the usurpation of Milan by Lodovico Sforza.
Charles was coming into Italy to dethrone these evil
and malignant princes, “fathers of all treason,” as
the author of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De Bello Gallico”</span> has called them;
“tyrants by whom I think that Nero himself would
seem a saint.” But now that the French were
actually in Lombardy, it struck the Italian despots
with ominous force that he might not be content with
only Naples. Few of them had any just title to their
possessions; none of them, save Venice, could resist
the power of France. “The princes of Italy,” wrote
the Venetian secretary, “aghast at this passing of the
mountains, tried to arrange that the King should pass
no farther south, each one doubting for his own
estate, and doubting most of all the enthusiasm of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>his own subjects.” For if the tyrants of Italy dreaded
the advent of the French, the populace—the poor,
starved, degraded slaves of these illegal despots—welcomed
their coming with open arms. “They were
so called and cried upon,” goes on our author, “so
invoked by all the populace of Italy, that there was
none who could withstand them, for all the people
said <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini</em></span>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Sorely he was needed, that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Flagellum Dei</em></span>, of whom
the inspired voice of Savonarola prophesied daily in
the great Cathedral of Florence. Sorely he was required.
For that autumnal Italy which at their
coming the Frenchmen found so fair, was no more
than a waving green enchanted garden full of poisons—poisons
for the body, swift or slow, used without
scruple by Venice and Milan as a means to power, by
Rome as an easy way to wealth, by Naples for the vile
gratification of cruel passions. The terrible pages
from the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Secreta Secretissima,”</span> published by Lamansky
in 1884, the folios of Marino Sanuto’s
“Diaries,” the chronicles which fill the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“Archivio
Storico,”</span> are full of tragic murders, the more tragical
because so commonplace; and the quiet, impartial
voice of Philippe de Commines falters when he speaks
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“les pitiez d’Italie.”</span></p>

<p class='c006'>Not only poison for the enviable, slavery for the
conquered, famine and cruelty for the poor, and
treachery among the princes of the earth; for all
alike there was a corrupt and horrible dissolution of
moral restraints. “There is no city in Italy,” records
the Venetian, “not Rome or Naples, not Bologna,
Florence, Milan, or Ferrara, not my own Venice even,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>that is holier than the Cities of the Plain.” Milan,
with the frescoes of Leonardo fresh upon the walls;
Venice, where the girl-madonnas of Giovanni Bellini
were not yet all begun; Florence, peopled with the
saints of Botticelli, with the angels of the aged
Gozzoli upon the walls of Piero de’ Medici’s palace;
Ferrara, where the youthful Ariosto dwelt—these
homes of the brightest and the fairest art were
morally no better than the Rome of the Borgias or
the Naples of Ferdinand and Alfonso. They were
vile dens of corruption. And yet the painted angels
of Florence, the saints of Lombardy, were <em>not</em> a mere
external fashion, a refined hypocrisy; they were the
expression of a movement in Italian hearts deeper
than even this permeating evil—pure underneath the
mask of their perversion. When the French came
into Lombardy they found a contagion of spiritual
enthusiasm among the people; they encountered holy
women who neither ate, drank, nor slept, but dwelt in
a continual ecstasy; and as they went along the roads
the poorer inhabitants came out to meet them, bearing
palms in their hands, and having on their pale
and haggard faces a strange exalted smile. “Blessed
is he,” they sang, “who cometh in the name of the
Lord;” for the people were eager to be quit of the sin
that hemmed them round. They embraced the knees
of their conquerors, and suffered willingly a great
deal of hardship at their hands, glad to be purified for
ever by the Scourge of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>Had it not been for the welcome that they met, the
French could never have penetrated into Italy. They
came ill-provided, without good generals, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>money. “There’s not a penny in the treasury,”
wrote Orleans to Ridolfi, in October, “and I have
spent four thousand ducats of my own to pay the
troops.” The Italian despots trusted that this lack
of means would cause the French to retire before the
winter, and Orleans was in secret treaty with them to
this end. Milan, says this interested advocate, would
be enough to satisfy the honour of France—Milan
and a yearly homage paid by Naples to the Crown of
France.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c014'><sup>[114]</sup></a> But these designs were frustrated by the
enthusiasm with which the French were received in
the invaded provinces. The women brought their
jewels to pay the troops; the men threw open the
gates of the cities; every difficulty was overridden,
for, says Commines, touched with the grave exaltation
of Italy, “God was Himself our leader: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Dieu monstroit
conduire l’entreprise</em></span>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“At our first arrival,” he goes on, “the people
honoured us as saints, supposing all faith and virtue
to be in us; but this opinion endured not long.” The
rude French soldiery—Gascons, Normans, Swiss, and
German mercenaries—pathetically ignorant of the
fancied aureole playing round their weatherbeaten
faces, marched through Italy as through any other
conquered country. At Rapallo they put the town to
the sword; they took Fivizzano by a murderous
assault; they shed much blood at Pontremoli; for
they could not understand that they seemed the Elect
of Heaven, and they sought by fierce reprisals to keep
up a military prestige. But if in Lombardy, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>Lunigiana, the rude passage of the troops had to
some extent dispelled the illusions of the people—where
the army had not yet arrived the cities with
open gates awaited it in holy awe. Arragon retired
from point to point without a battle fought. The
subjects of Catarina Sforza threatened her with
rebellion if she refused submission to the French;
Bologna, against the will of Bentivoglio, insisted on
making peace with Charles. And in the Duomo of
Florence, where Savonarola preached of the Purifying
Scourge of God, the people shouted, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“Franza,
Franza!”</span> where they were only used to sob in bitter
patience, “Misericordia.” And to these enthusiasts,
impatient of Medicean luxury, it was no drawback
that the King, their deliverer, was a mere ugly youth,
“more a monster than a man,” as Guicciardini
plainly states, quite uncultured, and knowing neither
Greek nor Latin. “In fact,” as the Milanese Corio
remarked, “an uninstructed person, though none the
less able to address his soldiery in telling terms, so
that for love of him they dash upon the enemy,
shouting, ‘Alive or dead!’” In the autumn of 1494
this ugly, bright-eyed youth had inspired an equal
devotion in the populace of Florence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The people were led by the monk Savonarola; but
many of the old Florentine families (the Nerli,
Gualterotti, Sonderini, Capponi) were no less anxious
than the people to banish their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>parvenu</em></span> tyrant. Out of
all the crowd of monks, enthusiasts, bankers, patricians,
and politicians which made up the popular party, two
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>silhouettes</em></span> stand strongly forth. One is the preacher
Savonarola—a man of middle height, of dark complexion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>and sanguine, bilious temperament. At forty-two
his face is lined with seams and wrinkles—a harsh,
strong face with a sweet expression, like Samson’s
honey in the lion’s mouth; eyes that flash and flame
from under shaggy black eyebrows and shed their
spiritual gleam over the heavy Roman nose and the
large mouth with the loose, thick lips of the orator
firmly closed and drawn into a painful smile; a kind,
noble, spiritual, tragic face, with something mad in it,
or something at the least that must pass for mad in
this uninspired and transitory world.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was the man who for a good four years was
virtually the ruler of Florence; this was the man
who, more than any other, helped on the cause of
France in Italy. “A man of holy life,” says Commines,
who knew him. And Guicciardini describes him:
“Full of charity, of natural goodness, and religion—so
clever in philosophy, one would think he himself
had had the making of it; without a trace of lust or
avarice; but if he had a vice it was simulation, the
prompting of a proud ambition.” One more voice
arrests us: “A treacherous friar, worthy the end of
the wicked.” But it is Marino Sanuto who speaks,
the political enemy of Savonarola and a personal
stranger to his qualities.</p>

<p class='c006'>Behind the strong profile of the friar we note
another head, also worthy of remark. This is Piero
Capponi, a man of old Florentine family, republican
by descent. Sturdily built and square, with brilliant
eyes, he has a certain air of a courser sniffing battle;
brief and resolute in speech, vigorously mature in
age, he seems the very embodiment of virile energy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>He is rich, for an astrologer at his birth having foretold
his death in battle, he was persuaded by his
father to devote himself to commerce. The man
worked at money-getting with the restless, dominant
force he put into everything he did, and made his
fortune in a sort of fury. Then he threw up his
career, having enough, and entered public life at
thirty years of age. A republican, his restless need
of activity made him accept the Medicean service.
He had been ambassador in France, and was as
French as Savonarola. “See them near, like ghosts,”
he used to say, “and there is nothing to be afraid of
in these French.” Although at this time the right arm
of the Republic, his patrician birth, his acquaintance
with the magnificence of princes, made him recoil from
the extremer measures of the monk. A man of the
greatest spirit, the staunchest energy, the very width
of his views and his natural love of change made
him a danger to a peaceful but imperfect Government.
Born to be a great captain, he loved, above all things,
a difficult campaign; and he spent his life in fighting
alternately his enemies and his friends, until at last
the astrologer’s prediction, true in spite of human
prudence, set a bridle on his martial soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>These two men represent the two parties who chiefly
desired the advent of the French—the enthusiasts, the
poor, the children of Savonarola, and the powerful
burghers, as rich and may be better born than Piero
de’ Medici, who resented their tyrant’s views on the
republic, who resented almost more his alliance with
the detested Spanish autocrats of Naples. On the
other side—the side of the Orsini, of Cardinal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>Bibbiena, of Bernardò del Nero, and the aristocratic
party, there is but one man that can arrest us as
Capponi or Savonarola must arrest us, and that is
Piero de’ Medici himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Piero and the King of France were mortal enemies;
the King of Naples had no more resolved ally than
Medici, though the French inclinations of the city
prevented him from showing the true colour of his
opinions. He was, in fact, “immoderately bound up
with Arragon, and determined to chance the same
fortune,” as Guicciardini tells us; since in return for
this alliance he had arranged that Ferdinand of Naples
should support him in turning his old republic into a
new monarchy. Naples in those days represented in
Italy the kingdom as distinguished from the Signory;
it was the natural pole-star of the aristocrat. And
Piero was drawn to the south as much by sentiment
as by inclination; his mother Clarice, his young wife
Alfonsina, both came of the Roman family of Orsini.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1494 Piero de’ Medici was about four-and-twenty
years of age. He was beautiful in person and very
vigorous. He was clever at games and sports; he
had a charming way of pronouncing his words, a
winning voice, and a great facility in making <a id='corr321.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='impromtu'>impromptu</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_321.24'><ins class='correction' title='impromtu'>impromptu</ins></a></span>
verses. But this handsome, graceful personage
was not popular in Florence. He was haughty
and arrogant beyond expression, subject to furies of
animal anger, proud, and cruel. He would have men
waylaid at night in the street and beaten violently by
private bravos. He was so absolute, that even in
matters he did not pretend to understand, he would
govern all according to his fancy. And this aristocrat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>of a free republic was as fiery, vain, careless, and
impatient as he was presumptuous. While the people
murmured “Franza” with white excited faces; while
Savonarola was thundering his prophecies of the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Flagellum Dei</em></span>; while news of the massacres and the
irresistible advance of France struck a religious terror
into Tuscany—the young head of the state left the
garrisons unprovided and unguarded; not a week’s
provisions in Sarzana or Pietra Santa; not a handful
of infantry in the fastnesses of the hills. While
winds of rebellion, war, and outrage swept the city,
he, the one man unmoved, was to be seen as usual
playing <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>pallone</em></span> in the public streets, a light-minded
aristocrat, full of a certain easy and handsome
bravado, caring for no one’s safety, not even for his
own.</p>

<p class='c006'>But even Piero, as he knocked the tennis-ball
against the palace front, must now and then have felt
a certain twinge of anxiety. For every day brought
news of the farther retreat of Arragon, and only
success, and brilliant success, could justify the
Arragonese alliance in the eyes of the Florentines.
Already that aristocratic alliance had touched the
mercantile republic in a sensitive point: in June the
King of France had expelled the Florentine bankers
and merchants out of his kingdom. This meant ruin
to many honourable families, and decided the
burghers to join the party of Savonarola, so weakening
the Medicean faction that people whispered it was
Capponi who had thus advised King Charles, in order
to disgust the impoverished merchants with their
tyrant. But the documents published in Desjardins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>contradict this supposition. It was from Lodovico il
Moro, the determined enemy of Florence and of Piero,
that King Charles accepted this happy suggestion.</p>

<p class='c006'>The burghers were all for France, in order to regain
their commerce. The people, under Savonarola, the
Republican families under Capponi, desired nothing
more than the advent of King Charles. The very
cousins of Piero himself had become so French, that
a year ago he had exiled them to their country villas,
where they lived in comfortable durance, surrounded
by the light of popular martyrdom. To resist all
these varied forces, Piero, on his side, could count a
few old friends of his father, such as Bernardò del
Nero and his secretary Bibbiena, an ambitious priest,
and his wife’s brother, Pagolo Orsini, captain of the
forces of the republic.</p>

<p class='c006'>The situation was grave indeed, but he took it
lightly, with a facile temerity that would not condescend
to prudence. On the 3rd of October his
ambassador at Milan wrote that the French spoke of
wintering in Pisa and Sarzana. Yet not a single
fortress had a week’s provisions. So late as the 22nd
of October, in answer to a last appeal from France,
he sent the Bishop of Arezzo to King Charles with a
vague, exasperating, indecisive answer. The same
week the two cousins of Piero escaped from their
villas, and rode post-haste to the French camp.
“Sire,” they cried to Charles, “be not angry with
Florence. The tyrant is against you, but you have
the faithful devotion of the people.” The King was
well inclined to believe the two young men with whom
he had often practised, and who had suffered a year’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>imprisonment for his sake. “We do not confuse the
people of Florence with the governor,” answered the
Council. “The last alone is the King’s enemy.”
And, departing from Piacenza, the armies of France
marched on the Florentine territories.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a few days they were on the Tuscan border. At
Fivizzano and Pontremoli they had so avenged a
slight resistance that the gates flew open at their
approach. Who dare resist the Scourge of God?
Terror and awe bent every head before them. In
Florence the populace surged along the narrow streets,
and declared they would not resist the King of France.
Three days after Piero had sent off the Bishop of
Arezzo, a popular tumult seemed ready to burst at
any moment.</p>

<p class='c006'>What could he do? The French were now within
fifty miles of Pisa, and though the mountain fortresses
ought to have kept them at bay all the winter long,
Piero remembered too late that he had forgotten to
provision them; that he had neglected to call the
Pisan hostages into Florence, and that Pisa hated her
cruel mistress, and was certain to revolt to France.
Only one course suggested itself to the desperate
young man, and this course was so adventurous,
romantic, and unusual, that it captivated at once his
unsteady imagination. Many years ago, when
Arragon had worsted Florence on the battlefield,
Lorenzo de’ Medici had gone as his own ambassador
to Naples, running, it is true, a great risk of steel or
poison, but by his fascinating address making a
devoted friend of an exasperated enemy. Piero
determined to follow the example of his father. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>the 26th of October he heard that the French were
arriving before Sarzana, within two days’ march of
Florence. On the evening of that day the tyrant of
Florence secretly escaped from his own palace, left
the city in the dusk of evening, and rode through the
chill autumn night as far as Empoli.</p>

Tell the Eight! Tell Alfonsina! Tell Monsignore.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c014'><sup>[117]</sup></a> Tell
Giuliano!”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>III.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Piero de’ Medici set out for the French camp from
Pietra Santa on the 30th of October. Although the
winter was afterwards so mild, the autumn had been
severe, and the roads were marvellously deep with
snow. All round Sarzana there extends a barren
country, desolate, and full of little hills. At last a
long ride of thirty miles brought the tired horsemen
in sight of the French camp. The tents were pitched
all round the frontier-fortress, a strong place in bad
repair, which had cost the Republic fifty thousand
florins not many years ago. Sarzana was guarded
by Sarzanello, a fort surrounded by great towers built
on a steep hill above the town. When Piero arrived
the French were beginning to bombard Sarzanello
with that strange, improved artillery of theirs which
caused such panic in Italy. The young man, alone
in the midst of an enemy he had done his best to
ruin, assailed by visions of death and prison, was exhausted
with fatigue, with restrained terror, and with
the novelty of his position. The French lords led
him at once to the tent of Charles. Contrary to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>expectations, the King—a young man of his own age—received
him kindly, even benignly. They were not
going to kill him after all. In the exquisite relaxation
of his dread, Piero sank upon his knees before
the King, stammered an excuse, and hung his handsome
head. “I will do everything your Majesty may
require!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Where was now that devotion to Arragon, which (as
he told Bibbiena with so proud a swagger) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>traho ad
immolandum</em></span>? Where was that loyalty, “which I
shall preserve in hell itself”? They had vanished
to that dim limbo of generous resolutions where
they would meet his fealty to the Republic, his
love of country, and his self-sacrificing affection for
his people. All these golden sentiments had completely
vanished from the mind of Piero. The warm
tent, after the long snowy ride, the kind reception, so
different from his terrified previsions, the amiable
friendliness of the French lords, who showed no
humiliating surprise at his visit, all combined to fill
him with a sense of genial relief. After all, Capponi
was right: “Look at these French near, and there is
nothing to be afraid of.” Piero, if he was afraid at
all, was only filled with that pleasant awe which the
reverential <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>parvenu</em></span> experiences when received on
kindly terms in aristocratic society. He had not
quite recovered yet from the honour that the French
had shown him in sending St. Malo and the King’s
herald to receive him. Perhaps on the rack Piero
might have kept his word an hour or so. It vanished
quite out of remembrance as soon as he felt the soft
influence of royal converse.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>And this was the King, the second Charlemagne,
the marvel of nations, the terrible <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Flagellum Dei</em></span>!
Piero, accustomed to the kind voice, raised his eyes,
and beheld a very small man of four-and-twenty,
unusually youthful in aspect, with high shoulders, a
sickly air, and extraordinarily thin long legs. He
looked not quite grown up; and he was certainly very
ugly, with his large head, long nose, wide mouth,
and timid, delicate appearance. His ugliness was,
however, redeemed by a pair of singularly beautiful
and shining eyes, whose intelligent, kind, straightforward
glance promised a liberal and honest nature.
The King was, in fact, both liberal and honest; a
simple, inconsequent, honourable creature, too nonchalant
to make himself obeyed, and too incapable
of dissimulation to win by art what he could not gain
by force. He was, we learn from Commines, “the
gentlest creature alive; of no great sense, but of so
good a nature it were impossible to find a kinder
creature; a youth but newly crept out of the shell.”
This description does not promise a very terrible
monarch, or an insidious diplomatist, but all the
duplicity of Lodovico il Moro could not have gained
a greater triumph than the careless good-nature of
Charles achieved over the flattered Florentine.</p>

<p class='c006'>The King sat like a quaint elfin child in his tent
among his splendid counsellors. These polite and
courtly people had rather a more decided smile than
usual about their pleasant lips as they glanced
towards Piero. The young Florentine was submerged,
drowned, in his satisfaction with the King
and with his own reception. He was on the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>terms with his friend, the King of France. Charles,
who did not quite understand the situation, asked
a great deal more than ever he hoped to obtain from
penitent Florence, thinking he would have to abate
his demands (a few weeks in Italy had taught him
how to bargain), especially when dealing with a
mercantile person like Piero de’ Medici. He put
forward in fact an extravagant requisition: the
Florentine troops were all to be dismissed (the troops
that Piero had ordered yesterday), the fortresses of
Sarzana, of Sarzanello, Librafatto, Pisa, Leghorn,
and Pietra Santa were to be delivered to the King;
his army was to have free passage, and he was to
receive a loan of 200,000 ducats. Now the French
party of Florence were prepared to allow the King to
lodge in Pisa, and to grant him a free passage, but
more than this had never been dreamed of by
Savonarola or Capponi. Piero, however, when he
heard the King’s demand, did not abate a jot of it.
Who was he to contradict the King? (“I go,” he
had said; “I go head down in front of peril to bring
you back a welcome message, or else to leave my
bones in the camp of the enemy!”) He immediately
agreed to grant the whole, yielding the entire force
and estate of Florence into the power of France.
“Those that negotiated with the said <a id='corr330.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Peter.'>Peter,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_330.25'><ins class='correction' title='Peter.'>Peter,</ins></a></span>” says
Commines, “have often told me, scoffing and jesting
at him, that they wondered to see him so lightly
condescend to so weighty a matter, granting more
than they looked for.” And Guicciardini adds:
“There was no Frenchman there that did not
greatly marvel that Piero so easily consented to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>matters of so great importance, because without a
doubt the King would have accepted very far inferior
conditions.” But Piero, the hero of fidelity, the new
Lorenzo, did not think of this. “I require the six
fortresses, the dismissal of your army, free passage,
and a loan of 200,000 ducats,” repeated the slow,
stammering, timid voice of the King. “I agree,”
said Piero.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a silence in the tent, half-amused, half-painful,
a feeling as if they had overreached a little
child.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Piero de’ Medici was not the only Italian tyrant
who had come to visit the camp of Charles before
Sarzana. The day after Piero had arrived, Lodovico
il Moro of Milan, who had been called home from
Piacenza by the most timely death of his nephew,
returned this time as Duke of Milan, to the tents of
his allies. He had not expected to encounter there
the ally of Alfonso, the tyrant of Florence, and the
meeting was not pleasant. Lodovico had an especial
dislike to Piero de’ Medici; firstly, because Florence
possessed the forts of Pietra Santa and Sarzana,
which used to belong to the Genoese, of whom Lodovico
was the suzerain; secondly, because Piero was
the staunchest ally of Arragon in Italy; and lastly,
because on one occasion that charming fool had
actually outwitted the wise Lodovico himself. On
this occasion Piero, suspecting Lodovico of a Janus
face that turned different fronts to Florence and to
France, had hidden the French ambassador behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>a screen in his audience-chamber, while he made
Lodovico’s ambassador protest that Charles had no
surer enemy than his master. The French envoy
had been very properly scandalized, but instead of
preserving a quiet distrust of Milan, King Charles
had proclaimed his wrongs from the house-tops;
Lodovico had persuaded him they were inventions of
the enemy, and henceforth had vowed an eternal hate
to Piero.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus there was a personal coolness between the
Duke of Milan and the head of the Florentine
Republic; but on political grounds their meeting was
still more awkward. Lodovico il Moro was a man
who loved to fish in troubled waters. He had sown
dislike and distrust between the French and Florence;
he had meant the Florentines to keep the troops of
Charles all the winter imprisoned in the fastnesses
of their hills. And when in the spring, the King,
disgusted with the Neapolitan enterprise, should
return to France, he had hoped to obtain for himself
whatever places the French had gained from Tuscany.
Lodovico had gained the great object which had
made him call the French into Italy; he was Duke
of Milan. He now wished no farther progress for
Charles. He hoped that the King might winter in
Tuscany, and then retire to France, having handed
over to Milan Sarzana and Pietra Santa, and leaving
behind an intimidated Naples, a plundered Florence,
a triumphant and victorious Milan. Judge of his
immense displeasure when he discovered that, in the
few days of his absence, Piero de’ Medici had delivered
to the King the passes of the Apennines.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Lodovico was of that far-sighted order of politicians
who, when a cherished project fails, have ever an
under-study ready to supply its place. It was an
unfortunate fact that nothing now prevented Charles
from making himself the lord of Italy; but at any
rate Milan might gain possession of the towns in the
Lunigiana. Lodovico went to Charles, and asked
him for the six fortresses which Piero had yielded
yesterday. But Charles, though a very simple and
youthful person, was not a fool; he would not close
himself in a trap in the South of Italy with all the
passes homeward shut behind him. He answered
Lodovico that he preferred to keep the fortresses, at
least until after his return from Naples. The Duke
of Milan was a grave and modest man, quiet in
manner and majestic, never irascible or angry; he
feigned to agree with his ally the King of France.
Yes, it would certainly be wiser for Charles to keep
the passes; and, to add a point to his conciliation,
he remembered that Milan owed the King the 30,000
ducats due for the investiture of Genoa.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, notwithstanding his beautiful manners, the
Duke of Milan did not smile when, in the King’s
camp, he encountered the man who had spoiled all
his well-considered policy. He had left Milan at an
awkward moment in order to get the promise of
Sarzana and Pietra Santa. The King had promised
him nothing; had got beyond his reach, had just
cost him 30,000 ducats; and all this was the fault
of Piero. The young Florentine saw the look of
irritation on Lodovico’s face, and in his eternal
self-preoccupation he thought it due to the fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>that he had received no official welcome into Tuscany.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I rode out to meet you yesterday,” cried Piero,
“but I could not find you anywhere. You must have
missed the way!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is true, young man,” said Lodovico, in his
grave, sinister voice; “it is true that one of us has
missed the way. But it is possible that <em>you</em> may be
the man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Charles—looking on, understanding little, thinking
far more of the falcon on his wrist than of the manœuvres
and intrigues of these Italians—Charles was
no match for either of these men. And yet, in
coming to his camp, each of them had missed the
way. Had the merciful curtain of the future been
for a moment lifted on that evening, either had
swooned with terror to see to what end that mistaken
path should lead them. What is this? An old
French street, surging with an eager mob, through
which there jostles a long line of guards and archers;
in their midst a tall man, dressed in black camlet,
seated on a mule. In his hands he holds his biretta,
and lifts up, unshaded, his pale, courageous face,
showing in all his bearing a great contempt of death.
It is Lodovico, Duke of Milan, riding to his cage at
Loches.</p>

<p class='c006'>And there, in the rapidly running Garigliano,
where the French soldiery are struggling in their all
too hasty flight, that dead, comely face, swirled here
and there by the dark, washing waters—that is the
face of Piero de’ Medici.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>V.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>But the end is not yet; a little longer the cunning
Lodovico and the empty-headed Medici have still
their parts to play, and for the next few days the
part of Piero is no easy one. He has to answer to
Florence for having delivered her, without her own
consent, into the hands of the French.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the Signory were still in ignorance of this sad
disposal of their fate. So soon as they discovered
the flight of Piero they sent off seven envoys to the
camp of Charles to treat with the King, “with Piero
or without Piero,” and to express the thanks of
Florence for his honourable welcome accorded “to
our fellow-citizen, Piero de’ Medici.” When the
seven Florentine negotiators arrived at the French
camp they found the French had been three days
already in Sarzana and Sarzanello; they found that
their fellow-citizen had dispossessed them of all that
they had gained in a hundred years or more—of
Sarzana, their frontier town; Pietra Santa, <a id='corr335.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='which which'>which</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_335.20'><ins class='correction' title='which which'>which</ins></a></span>
had cost them 150,000 ducats and a two
months’ siege; of Leghorn and Pisa—her seaports,
the two eyes of Florence—without which her commerce
were impossible: and he had promised, in the
name of the Republic, the extravagant subsidy of
200,000 ducats!</p>

<p class='c006'>Before the bad news could reach home the Signory
had sent off a second embassy of five: Tanai dei
Nerli, Savonarola, Capponi, and two other staunch
Republicans, Guelfs and democrats, the leaders of the
French party. They arrived to discover in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>late opponent a more disastrous friend, so French
that he had ceased to be Florentine at all. Capponi
then and there determined to prevent the continuance
of the Medici in Florence. Savonarola spoke
words of tragic warning to the astonished King: “If
thou respect not Florence, God shall whip thee with
His whips and scourges.” But no eloquence and no
resolve could change the fact that the French were
in the fortresses.</p>

<p class='c006'>So the twelve ambassadors mournfully set their
faces homewards; and Piero also returned to Florence—Piero,
brilliant, presumptuous, arrogant as
ever. There was no sign of shame or sorrow about
him; but even he could notice the cold reception of
the people. Every man frowned upon him as he
passed along the streets; they murmured together
and talked of banishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was the 8th of November when he came home
to Florence. On the morning of the 9th he rode to
the Piazza with his ordinary guard to announce the
King’s coming, but when he knocked at the gate of
the Palazzo Vecchio, young Nerli refused to let him
in unless he sent away his soldiery. Piero, indignant
at this behaviour, rode home again and sent a message
to his wife’s brother, Pagolo Orsini, captain of
the horse, to bid him lead the troops at once to
Florence. Meanwhile, in the streets the ominous cry
of “Liberty, liberty!” gathered and grew. All the
adventurous temper of Piero de’ Medici was roused.
Without waiting for the troops, he armed himself
and a few servants, and rushed cavalcading along
the hostile streets, crying out the rallying cry of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>family, “Palle! Palle!” But everywhere he was
met with sullen silence—silence that gradually broke
into a roar of disapproval, a shout of “Libertà!”
By the time Orsini and the soldiers came, Piero was
glad of their assistance, not to quell the disaffected
Florentines, but to escape from a town in open
mutiny. They left the women behind in the great
house in Via Larga, and, accompanied by a few
cavaliers, the three young Medici fled from their
city. Piero rode in the middle, disguised as a monk.
It was the second time in fourteen days that he had
secretly escaped from Florence.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the sun rose on the 10th of November,
Florence was in deed, as well as in name, a republic.
Piero was a fugitive in reproachful Bologna, a price
of 5,000 ducats on his head. Nor ever again, in
the ten remaining years of his life, did he re-enter
Florence; and when his brothers, seventeen years
after, were readmitted to their ancient home, it was
through the blood of Prato that they waded into
Florence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Florence would brave any danger rather than
receive the Medici. When King Charles, a few days
after the escape of Piero, made a brave stand for his
guest of Sarzana, the Florentines threatened him
with open war. “You can sound your trumpets,”
said Piero Capponi; “I will ring my bells.” Charles
looked out of the window at the narrow streets, at the
solemn, strong-walled city that, at the sound of the
tocsin, became a mysterious and terrible ambush,
raining death from every window, shooting unsuspected
sallies along the tortuous streets. He understood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>that a plain French soldier could not deal with
such an enemy as this. “Take off the price upon
his head,” he declared, “and I will say no more.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, had Piero gone at once to Charles
instead of to Bologna, the King might have forced
him back on Florence. But the young man fled from
Bologna to Venice; and when King Charles sent him
a message and bade him come to his camp, Piero
refused to stir. Piero Capponi, he said, had told him
the French King meant only to betray him. Piero
Capponi was at least resolved that his namesake
should no more betray the city, and by his persuasions
the Medicean Piero remained at Venice.
“There I often saw him,” wrote Commines, “and he
discoursed to me at large of all his misfortunes, and
I, as well as I could, comforted him. Methought
him a man of no great stuff or sense.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the eleventh century the King of Tunis asked of
the Pisan merchants at his Court: “What are the
Florentines?” “They are our Arabs of the desert,”
replied those prosperous tradesmen. “They are our
poor!”</p>

<p class='c006'>But in the next century these Arabs of Tuscany
proved themselves formidable rivals to their neighbours;
though for another hundred years Pisa, with
diminishing resources, retained a superior prestige.
That superiority of hers became the occasion of her
final ruin; for in 1197 when Volterra, Lucca,
Florence, San Miniato, Arezzo, and Siena united in
the Great Guelf League of Independence, Pisa alone
stood out resolutely Ghibelline, isolated in the
dignity of her Imperialism. This abstention of Pisa,
then the first of the Tuscan cities, gave to Florence
the front place in the League, and made her the head
of the Guelfs in Central Italy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thenceforth, for centuries Florence gloriously
flourished, while the fame of Pisa dwindled to a
mere proverb, an old tale but half believed. First
she lost her supremacy, then her wealth, then her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>renown, and at last her independence. A family of
despots arose in her midst. Soon she was to regret
this comparative liberty, for in 1397 Giangaleazzo
Visconti conquered the city, and left it, on his death
in 1402, to his mistress, Agnese Mantegazza, and to
their son, Gabriello Maria Visconti. But Messer
Gabriel’ Maria was not strong enough to keep Pisa
single handed against his envious neighbours of
Florence, Genoa, and Lucca; so on April 15, 1404,
he agreed to hold the city as a fief of France.</p>

<p class='c016'>Few of the details of history are more involved,
perplexed, or dependent on the revelations of unpublished
archives than the delicate intrigues of
France for the possession of Pisa. A <a id='corr340.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Mediterannean'>Mediterranean</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_340.15'><ins class='correction' title='Mediterannean'>Mediterranean</ins></a></span>
seaport, a link in the precious chain that ran (Marseilles,
Genoa, Pisa, Naples) from Provence to Sicily,
she was an invaluable supporter of the Angevines in
the south; and holding the passes of the Apennines, she
was scarcely less necessary to Orleans in Lombardy,
glad indeed of an ally among the Tuscan republics, so
irreconcilably inimical to the Visconti. But, as we
have already seen, the plans of Orleans were liable
to suffer from the counter plans of France; and as at
Genoa in 1395 so it was at Pisa in 1404.</p>

<p class='c006'>The great Visconti died in September, 1402; and in
the same year Marshal Boucicaut was sent as Governor
to Genoa. Boucicaut was an enemy of Milan,<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c014'><sup>[118]</sup></a> a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>hater of the Turk, a man who saw in the Visconti the
secret allies of the Sultan, a man who had been a
captive at Nicopolis. A pure, devoted, honourable
spirit, yet officious, yet impatient:—a restless hero
working persistently in a nervous and unquiet fashion
the thing that he believed to be the Will of God—Boucicaut
is a figure as unusual among the factions and
intrigues of fifteenth-century history as Gordon among
the small surroundings of to-day. The Marshal was
sent to Genoa because that jealous and unaccountable
people (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“qui n’aime pas qu’on aille leur desbauscher
leurs femmes”</span>) would no longer endure his
predecessor. They found in him the man they had
prayed to have, a sterner master. Boucicaut was as
rigid as he was simple: a man soon deceived, but
swift and inflexible in the punishment of treachery.
His immaculate life, his proved authority, his skill
in regulating and organizing commercial traffic, gave
him a great position in Northern Italy, made him the
man of men there, the central figure, even as before
him had been Giangaleazzo Visconti. For one
reason, these two men, so unlike in every detail,
were alike in the great fact that they were thinkers,
men with a mission, inspired by an idea that ruled
their lives and to which they subordinated every consideration.
The Duke of Milan dreamed of a great
United Italian Confederation, of which he should be
the head, and of which the Pope should be merely the
ornament and crown: his dream was the dream of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Emperor Napoleon III. Boucicaut, a crusader by
nature and tradition, above all things a religious
spirit, dreamed of ending the Schism, of gaining state
after state to the adherence of the true Pope at
Avignon, and, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>pari passu</em></span>, of extending the dominions
of his lord the King of France. The ambition of
Boucicaut was all spiritual loyalty and feudal devotion;
the ambition of Visconti, stained with crimes, was
directed only to self-aggrandizement: different stars
were theirs, shining from different poles. But the men
who see a star and follow where it leads them, though
they go as far apart as Hell and Heaven, have more
in common than the mere human bond which ties
them to the obscure multitude of their fellows, swaying
hither and thither, devoid of purpose, will, or way.</p>

<p class='c006'>Almost the first act of Boucicaut at Genoa was to
write to Florence inviting her to assist him in capturing
from the young Visconti (the Serpent-brood) one
of the finest cities between Milan and Piedmont.
The Florentines shared to the full the distrust of
Boucicaut for the children of him whom they had
called “the self-dubbed Count of Virtues (Vertus), the
veritable Count of Vice.” And they consented to the
enterprise, but yet did not pursue it. For, at that
moment, they had other work to hand. There was
another Visconti than the Lords of Milan and Padua
whom they must subdue. They were laying siege to
Pisa <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“e chi la tiene”</span>: her master Gabriel’ Maria
Visconti.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the same moment, as we know, Orleans beyond
the Alps was mysteriously advancing southwards;
his aim, no less than that of the Florentines, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>reduction of Pisa. For through his wife, Valentine
Visconti,<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c014'><sup>[119]</sup></a> he had, as he considered, a prior claim on
Pisa, and indeed on all possessions of the dead Duke
not included in the heritage of the two legitimate
sons. Gabriel’ Maria, the bastard, supported only
by his mother, besieged by the Florentine allies of
France, threatened by his brother-in-law the puissant
brother of the King of France,—what hope had he?
None indeed, save in the disquiet which the news of
Orleans’ coming might inspire among his neighbours.
For was it only on Pisa intent that so great a
lord was advancing on Lombardy? At this moment
the young Visconti of Milan were at open war with
Boucicaut, and had declared their intention to drive
him out of Genoa and to obtain for themselves the
rich province of which the French had baulked their
father. Did Orleans also remember with rancour
that disappointment of ten years ago? Did he intend
to join his brothers-in-law of Milan, take Genoa first
and Pisa afterwards? It might be; and yet it were
difficult to be at once the ally of the Milanese
Visconti, and the usurper of their half-brother’s
possessions. Was it possible that the King’s brother
intended to unite his army to that of the King’s
lieutenant, defeat the young Visconti before Genoa,
drive them from Lombardy as well as out of Pisa,
and make for himself a great territory (Milan, Asti,
Pisa) alongside of the French protectorate of Genoa?
Boucicaut was an ancient and intimate companion
of the Duke of Orleans; it was rumoured that
Orleans had frequent interviews with Pope Benedict
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>at Beaucaire; it was possible that the three had
come to an understanding.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Orleans marched south. And Florence assailed
Pisa. So late as April 17, 1404,<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c014'><sup>[120]</sup></a> the Florentines
believed that by diplomacy, if not by force, they might
secure their prey. But in the end of February or the
beginning of March the Duke of Orleans turned north
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>in high dudgeon, indignantly marching on Paris.
And in April it was commonly known that, on the
4th of that month, Messer Gabriel’ Maria Visconti
had been acknowledged a vassal of the Crown of
France; he was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“homme du Roy”</span> and the King’s
men henceforth would support him in Pisa.</p>

<p class='c006'>Great was the wrath of Orleans, loud the remonstrance
of Florence. Orleans had scarcely arrived in
Paris before the King transferred to him all the Royal
rights to Pisa (as I have already shown the reader
in the chapter on Valentine Visconti), and formally
disowned the conduct of Boucicaut, forbidding him in
future to put any obstacle in the path of his brother.
Censured at home, Boucicaut was not less fervently
condemned by his allies in Italy. The Signory of
Florence addressed a most indignant letter to him,<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c014'><sup>[121]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>accusing him of a dishonest action in seizing from
the King’s faithful allies the prey they had hunted so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>long, now, in their very grasp, to be wrested from
them by a friend. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“Questa non era honesta cosa.”</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>The Florentines could easily have reduced Pisa, but
against the fief of France, their ally, they could do
nothing. They withdrew from the siege, protesting
and with many murmurs.</p>

<p class='c006'>What indeed was the motive of Boucicaut? The
Florentines with some reason suspected an unseen
hand pulling the strings that worked this sudden
action; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“pensiamo che questo sia proceduto da altri,
con velati colori.”</span> But what man save the King, who
disowned the business, was strong enough to dare to
oppose the will of Orleans? Was Burgundy jealous
of those Italian prospects of his rival which freed him
from his neighbourhood at home? Or was it possible
that the Antipope Benedict, ill-contented with Orleans
after their interview at Beaucaire, had privately summoned
Boucicaut <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“ce bon Chrestien”</span> to hold Pisa in
the King’s name and not in the name of his too powerful
guardian? Mysteries! It is as likely, perhaps more
likely, that Boucicaut, ever hot-headed, wilful, and
officious, asked no permission save his own to accept
this new vassal for the King of France. His brain
was fired by the thought of converting Pisa to the
true obedience; and he feared that she would fall to
heretic Florence ere Orleans could pass the Alps.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gabriel’ Maria Visconti and his mother were ill at
their ease in Pisa. He, an elegant, faithless, persuasive
<em>Tiranetto</em> (as the Tuscans called him), was often at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>the Court of Boucicaut, making various negotiations,
among others handing over the Tower and Fort of
Leghorn to France.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c014'><sup>[122]</sup></a> Boucicaut was in high spirits
notwithstanding his half disgrace; he had persuaded
the Genoese to accept the authority of Benedict XII.,
“the greatest deed,” writes his biographer, “that has
been done in Italy these 200 years.” He hoped soon
to convert Leghorn and Pisa; and, in time, to induce
Italy to renounce the heinous Italian Antipope.</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly his hold over Pisa ominously slackened.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Pisans cared little for Pope or Antipope; they
were fanatic for liberty. They detested Agnese
Mantegazza and her bastard with a Tuscan hatred for
the Visconti, treacherous alike to God and man. One
day in 1405, while Messer Gabriel’ Maria was absent
in Genoa, some Florentine soldiers made a raid on
Pisa. The citizens, not without reason, suspected their
tyrant of selling them to the Florentines,—old neighbours
and rivals yet more odious than the Milanese.
They rose as one man fighting for death or liberty in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>the streets. No sooner had they driven back the
Florentines than they rushed on the Fortress, surging
through the narrow corridors, till, in the heart of
the palace, they came on Madonna Agnese. A man
raised his harquebuss and shot her through the heart.
Her son was absent in Genoa. For the moment the
Pisans were quit of the Visconti.</p>

<p class='c006'>The news of the revolt of Pisa flew swiftly to Genoa.
The bereaved Tiranetto dispossessed and orphaned,
repaired to Boucicaut as to the Lieutenant of his
liege-lord, the King of France, asking aid because,
as the Chronicle reminds us, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“seigneur doibt au
besoing secourir son vassal qui le requiert à son
aide.”</span></p>

<p class='c006'>Boucicaut was dismayed at this first result of his
new acquisition. To reduce Pisa by arms would be a
ruinous affair. The Marshal comforted as best he
could the vassal of his master, and promised to go and
reason with the rebels. Forth, therefore, he went from
Genoa to a very beautiful place called Porto Venere,
in the neighbourhood of Pisa. There a deputation
of the insurgents awaited him, and for a long while
he harangued them as to the virtues of the dead
Madonna Agnese and the merits of the kind and
amiable young man whom they had banished.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Pisans listened respectfully while <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“moult leur
dict de belles paroles,”</span> but when the sermon was
over they replied that never should Messer Gabriel’ be
their lord again, rather would every man of them
be hewn in pieces; but, they went on to say, the
Marshal Boucicaut himself should be welcomed and
honoured by all the citizens of Pisa, if he would accept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>her as his fief. “Never,” cried the Marshal, “could
I draw such a profit from a friend’s misfortune” (“car
ce n’est mie l’usaige des François d’user de tels tours”).
And he fell again to praising Messer Gabriel’, but all
in vain, for the last word of the Pisans was that, if
the Marshal himself would not accept the city for
his own, then they prayed him to meet them at
Leghorn another day, and there they would give
themselves directly to the King of France, accepting
a French governor for their waiter, even as the
Genoese had done ten years before.</p>

<p class='c006'>Boucicaut went home, sore perplexed between his
duty to his liege and his duty to his vassal. He had gone
to Porto Venere to plead the cause of Gabriel’ Maria:
and he had supplanted the young man, as it seemed.
On the other hand, since it was clear that the Pisans
would never re-admit their Tiranetto, and since the
city was the fief of France, how could he honourably
forbid them to give themselves entirely to their lawful
suzerain? And the vision grew in him of a great
Mediterranean State, French, supporting French
interests in the East—a terror to the Saracens and
the men of Barbary, a lamp of Christendom, faithful
to the True Obedience, reclaimed for ever from the
heresy of the Elect of Rome.</p>

<p class='c006'>Arrived in Genoa he sent for Messer Gabriel’, and
told him the case; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“de quoy feult moult dolent Messire
Gabriel,”</span> who doubtless wished that he had sent
to Porto Venere, a spokesman less eloquent and less
engaging. But Boucicaut persuaded him that since
he could not hope to leave the city for himself, ’twas
better to entrust it to the King of France—who would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>recompense so generous a vassal with lands as good
elsewhere—than to let it fall into the power of an
enemy or a neighbour. Gabriel’ Maria agreed—as he
must perforce agree—and Boucicaut set out again to
meet the rebels at Leghorn.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the Pisans had never meant to give themselves
another master. To gain time, they had played with
Boucicaut and had flattered his weak side. They said
that on second thoughts they preferred that, before
they gave themselves to the King of France, the men
of Messer Gabriel’, who were still in the strong places
of Pisa, should be expelled the city, and a garrison of
French and Genoese sent thither in their stead. The
request appeared the less unreasonable as Gabriel’
Maria was himself the King’s vassal, and the Pisans
might suspect that their mutual suzerain would only
confirm the power of the rejected <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Tiranetto</em></span>. Boucicaut
agreed, returned to Genoa, and arranged for the
exchange of garrisons.</p>

<p class='c006'>This done the Pisans sent to say the Fortress
needed revictualling. Boucicaut, eager to ingratiate
his new subjects, despatched his nephew, some gentlemen
of his household, with many gentlemen and citizens
of Genoa; and a great galley heaped with provisions.
The ship sailed down the coast and up the
Arno into Pisa; at the quay the embassy descended.
They were immediately overpowered by an ambush of
Pisans, who seized upon the welcome cargo of the ship,
and carried off the crew and the passengers into a dark
and villainous prison, using their sufferings as a means
to extract higher ransom from the King’s Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus amply provisioned at Boucicaut’s expense, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>Pisans began to feel secure of liberty. They sent to
Florence, offering her four of their castles if she would
help them to regain Leghorn, where at the moment
Boucicaut and Gabriel’ Maria were esconced, and to
revenge themselves on both these men. But the
Florentines returned a dilatory answer, for they
were, in truth, pursuing a more fruitful negotiation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Florence in 1405 was in the very hey-day of her
wool trade, but she had no outlet for her tides of
commerce, no port from which to ship her goods to
Provence or to Barbary. It was not four Pisan
castles, but Pisa herself and the mouth of the Arno
that she required. At the same time that the Pisans
proposed their bargain to the Florentine Ten, that
august body had received an ambassador from Gabriel’
Maria Visconti offering to sell them not only Pisa, but
also the frontier castles of Sarzana and Librafatto,
which, from the fastnesses of the Apennines, guard the
plain in which Pisa and Florence lie. It was worth a
great price to secure not only a port, but a fortified
frontier in case of an invasion from the north.
Florence remembered her ancient terrors when she
had lain almost at the mercy of the Duke of Milan.
She agreed to pay Messer Gabriel’ the sum of four
hundred thousand florins for his rights over his
revolted signory. They stipulated, however, that
Boucicaut must be acquainted with the transaction,
and give it his sanction, otherwise no bargain.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the persuasive Gabriel’ Maria broke the news
to his host, at first the Marshal <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“qui toujours y avoit
la dent,”</span> emphatically refused to consent to the alienation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>of a Royal fief; he even sent to Pisa to acquaint
the rebels with the designs of their ex-tyrant, hoping
by this means to induce them to declare themselves
the subjects of the King. But the Pisans went on
shouting <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“Libertà.”</span> Meanwhile Gabriel’ Maria and
the Florentines set the matter before the Marshal in
another light. For Messer Gabriel’—a clever person—advised
the Florentines to become vassals to the
Crown of France for the fief of Pisa. The Florentines
fell in with the suggestion, which carried visible weight
with the Boucicaut. And the Marshal was left to
consider the matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Florentines asked Leghorn as well as Pisa,
but Boucicaut was obstinate in his hold on the nearer
port. He could not yield Leghorn without grave prejudice
to Genoa. But Pisa was his only in name.
Could he not keep Leghorn, the substance, and as the
price of Pisa, the shadow, exact the fealty of the
Florentines to France and to the true Pope? Illuminated
by this bright idea Boucicaut proposed the
following terms to Florence:</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The Florentines shall have Pisa and all its lands
except the Castle of Leghorn; but they must swear
not to interfere with the carrying trade of Genoa, nor
to make traffic by sea in any other ships than those of
Genoa.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. A month after the reduction of Pisa the Florentines
must declare their adhesion to Pope Benedict
XIII., and charge themselves with the conversion of
Pisa.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. If, six months after the said reduction of Pisa,
the Elect of Rome still persist in his error, the Florentines,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>the French, and the Genoese shall all make
war on him together.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c014'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>4. That the ratification of King and Council shall
be asked for this agreement.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Florentines agreed, and messengers were
despatched to France, where there was great joy in
Council at thus receiving two Signories for one. The
King confirmed the agreement (it is said) by letters-patent,
which were sent to Genoa and Florence. The
Ten paid certain sums (as we learn from a later letter),
to Gabriel’ Maria, and other moneys to Boucicaut;
and then in earnest the Florentines resumed the
siege of Pisa.</p>

<p class='c006'>Famine fought with them and pestilence; yet valiant
Pisa proved irreductible. Month after month sped on
in fruitless heroism, and a year after the resumption
of the siege the Florentines were still indefatigably
attacking, the Pisans heroically defending. Then the
beleaguered city sent by privy ways a messenger to
Ladislas, King of Naples, offering herself to him if he
would defend her. The King promised, but did nothing.</p>

<p class='c006'>After a month or so the Pisans smuggled out a
second messenger, this time to France, who offered the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>city to the Duke of Burgundy on the same terms.
Mindful of the agreement of last year which assigned
Pisa to Florence, Burgundy hesitated; and, perceiving
his perplexity, the Pisan envoys <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“qui assez sçavoient
le tour de leur baston,”</span> addressed themselves to
certain of the Councillors of Orleans, and promised
the city to him; whereupon the said Councillors
induced Orleans and Burgundy, enemies as they were,
to go hand in hand to the poor bewildered King and
beseech him to grant them leave to accept the homage
of Pisa. Charles, doubtless, was not quite in his
right mind. The deed granting Pisa to Burgundy and
Orleans<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c014'><sup>[124]</sup></a> is signed “For the King” by the Count of
Tancarville and other princes. An ancient dependence
upon Burgundy, a blind affection for Orleans
(<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“rien n’eut refusé à son frère”</span>), united with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>perplexed and feeble memory, to obliterate the treaty of
last year. The King forgot his new vassals, forgot the
Pope, the schemes of Boucicaut, the money that had
been paid him by the Florentines on account of the
agreement. He granted Pisa to Burgundy and
Orleans, who wrote to the Florentines that they must
raise the siege at once, and sent to Boucicaut bidding
him assist the Pisans.</p>

<p class='c006'>The previous difficulties of Boucicaut had been as
nothing compared to this dilemma. How could he
refuse his service to the King, his lord and suzerain?
How, on the other hand, could he break his plighted
word? The vassal and the man of honour struggled
together in his breast; and from that long and cruel
duel the man of honour emerged triumphant. So
Boucicaut refused to desert his Florentine allies,
refused to assist the Royal fief of Pisa.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the Florentines pressed closer and closer round
the beleaguered city, the Pisans for the third time
contrived to smuggle out a messenger who was to
make his way as best he could to Asti (the city of
Orleans), and thence to France to beseech the King
to send a messenger and reinforcements.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c014'><sup>[125]</sup></a> But the
Pisan envoy was discovered in the Florentine camp,
and Capponi, the General, drowned him in the sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>So that when the news of his interception came to
Paris, it was too late for aught but indignation. “The
Florentine merchants had to suffer for it,” says Corio;
and Desjardins (in his introduction to the Tuscan
Statipassers), expresses his astonishment at the
obstacles laid in the way of Florentine trade by Marshal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>Boucicaut that year. For human nature is not
consistent, and though Boucicaut had indignantly
refused to desert his allies of Florence, none the less
he was wrath at their success, which meant the injury
of France.</p>

<p class='c006'>For on the 10th of October, 1406,<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c014'><sup>[126]</sup></a> a Florentine
army marched into Pisa, garrisoned the citadels, established
their government, and marched back with many
hostages to Florence. Pisa was honourably lost to
France.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c014'><sup>[127]</sup></a> Pisa was lost, and great was the sting
and smart of it. Railing and bitter names flung at
Boucicaut, detention of the Florentine Ambassadors
by <a id='corr358.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Orleans'>Orleans,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_358.13'><ins class='correction' title='Orleans'>Orleans,</ins></a></span><a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c014'><sup>[128]</sup></a> wrath of the King himself, were each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>and all wholly unavailing. Florence was the King’s
ally and too great a power to be rashly assailed; and
Florence was firm in Pisa.</p>

<p class='c006'>Had Orleans lived, he might indeed have undertaken
an expedition into Italy. But in the middle of
his disappointment he was murdered as we know.
Messer Gabriel’ Maria went to Milan, where he lived
half a captive,<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c014'><sup>[129]</sup></a> half a traitor for some while; and then
took refuge again in Genoa. But in the year 1409
being detected by Boucicaut in a plot of singular
treachery against the French, he was ruthlessly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>beheaded. Three years later, in 1412, after Gabriele’s
death that plot succeeded. Boucicaut and the French
were expelled from Genoa; and the wars of Burgundy
and Armagnac, the woes of Agincourt and the long
invasion of the English, for thirty years diverted the
French from their endeavours to colonize beyond the
Alps.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>II.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The Florentine conquest was the beginning of
ninety years of slavery for Pisa—a terrible slavery,
heavy with exaggerated imports, bitter with the
tolerated plunder of private Florentines, humiliating
with continual espionage. Ruin fell upon the lovely
city; and as the waters of the sea crept slowly back
over the reclaimed Maremma, they sapped the foundations
of her fairest palaces. Malaria and decay
went hand in hand along the streets; though round
the ruined town, the only whole thing there, the
strong forts of Florence, proclaimed the wealth and
power of the oppressor. It was not that the Florentines
were avaricious; they spent abundantly and
lavishly on fortifications and garrisons for their
soldiers; on a university in Pisa for their sons; and
they paid the most imaginative of living Florentine
painters to put his frescoes on the walls of the Pisan
Campo Santo. But they spent their money in the
Master’s way, declaring and sustaining the glory of
Florence rather than alleviating the miseries of Pisa.
And the Pisans themselves were unable either to
supply the omissions of Florence, or to direct and
advise a more efficient expenditure. They had descended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>into a nation of poor artizans, for all their
ancient trades were now forbidden to them. Florence
had secured the first place for her own manufactures,
by absolutely prohibiting the wool-weaving, silk-spinning,
ship-building, in which the Pisans had for
so many centuries excelled. Moreover no Pisan
might barter merchandise by land or sea. Restricted
to the commonest handicrafts, they lost the resource
of wealth; deprived of public office, denied the most
ordinary civil rights, they sank into a mute and
long-enduring slavery, secretly nourishing a spark
of flame in their rebellious hearts.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pisa was the Ireland of Florence, captive and yet
unvanquished. Ever ready to revolt, never for an
hour forgetful of her antique superiority. By means
of the many exiles that Florence expelled from home,
she kept continually in touch with the enemies of
Florence. Men expelled for private crimes—the
meanest of the Pisans—turned patriots in exile and
dedicated the best of their souls to the service of an
unhappy country. The Florentines, prosperous and
successful, were divided among themselves into half-a-dozen
different factions; and patriotism for them
meant largely a pious self-satisfaction dashed with
party principles. But the magic of an unfortunate
glory, the pathos that hangs over the place of one’s
birth when it has once been great and is fallen into
ruin—this personal and omnipotent sentiment inspired
every rank and every kind of Pisan. There was none
of them that would have shrunk from any heroism,
or (as it seemed to the Florentines) from any
treachery, in order to reinstate his country in her
ancient grandeur.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>It was with Venice and with Milan that the Pisans
held especial practice. It mattered little to them
that at heart these two powers were deadly enemies;
that ever since the death of Filippo Maria Visconti
the Venetians had been plotting with Orleans to
destroy the house of Sforza; that Lodovico il Moro
left no chance unchallenged to limit the pretensions
of his Adriatic rival. The Pisans were of neither
party; their one political tenet was hatred of their
conquerors, and (as a little later they declared) of the
two, they preferred the Devil to the Florentines.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such patience as theirs, ceaselessly labouring
underground, never wearied, militant but not aggressive,
does not fail to meet an opportunity. At last
a favourable chance was offered to the Pisans. The
King of France who in 1483 had disregarded the
invitation of the Venetians, accepted, ten years later,
the persuasions of Lodovico of Milan; and in the
autumn of 1494, the armies of Charles VIII. poured
into Italy.</p>

<p class='c006'>It had been the custom of the Florentines, in times
of war and danger, to call the heads of every Pisan
household into Florence, as hostages for the good
behaviour of their families and fellow citizens.</p>

<p class='c006'>But in the autumn of 1494, Piero de’ Medici who
forgot everything, who had forgotten to garrison his
frontier, forgot to call the Pisan hostages to Florence,
although the French were steadily advancing on
Tuscany and the Pisans eager to rebel. Every Pisan
household was intact at home on that memorable
30th of October when, in the snowy camp of the
French outside Sarzana, Piero de’ Medici handed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>the King of France the keys of the Tuscan fortresses.
It was of course provided that Charles should restore
the cities to the Florentines on his return from
Naples: but many things might happen in those
troublous times that would outweigh the value of
an oath. In the advent of King Charles, the Pisans
found the opportunity, so long, so patiently, so
ardently desired; and the French army and the
hope of liberty entered the unhappy city hand in
hand.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>III.</h3>

<p class='c016'>It was the 8th of November, and a Sunday evening
towards sunset, when the army of Charles VIII.
arrived in Pisa. The slanting rays of the autumn
sun lit up a brilliant spectacle, bathed in the soft
aërial richness of the miraculously warm St. Martin’s
summer which, in 1494, succeeded to the rigours of
the earlier months. Tired with their march across
the wintry Apennines, the foreign soldiers found in
Pisa a city full of friends. Tables were laid in the
streets where all might sup on wine and meat and
enjoy the hospitality of the city. Under foot the
branches of pine and boughs of autumn roses exhaled
their fresh aroma; and the ruined walls of the
cracked and damp-stained palaces were hidden by
the great squares of pale-crimson silk, gold brocade,
and Turkey carpets that were hung from every
window.</p>

<p class='c006'>Along these altered streets, embellished for the
festival, a train of priests, in stole and chasuble,
carrying their holiest relics, went out to meet the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>King. But this, the arranged and official feature
of his reception, faded, on the event, into absolute
unimportance. All took place at first as had been
designed. The great motley travel-stained crowd of
the French army came trampling down the boughs
of pine and roses; the priests met the soldiers; and
finally the King came riding on his great black horse,
Savoy, under the blue-silk canopy sustained by the
nobles of Pisa: but when the people caught sight
of this little young man, with the large head, bright
eyes, thin legs, high shoulders, and quaint amiable
air of elfin ugliness, then they forgot the dignity
of an official reception. This was the King of France!
This was the all-potent power which, at different
moments of history had stretched its invited and
benevolent ægis over Asti, Genoa, Savona, nay, even
over Naples and haughty Florence, to shelter them
from the cruelty of a tyrannic neighbour. But instead
of the dread magnificent symbolic monarch they had
expected to behold, lo, a benevolent, rather grotesque
little youth, with the most shining and enthusiastic
eyes, a kind ugly face, engaging rather timid manners,
and a total lack of that anti-human splendour which
these enslaved republicans had expected in a king.
A great wave of love, of anticipated gratitude swept
through the hearts of all these people: he was, he
must be, their hero, their deliverer. It was with tears
of passion streaming down their cheeks that men,
women, even little children, rushed into the ranks
of the astonished soldiery, seeing round each weather-beaten
face the shimmer of an aureole, pressing, hurrying,
thronging towards the King—crying all together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>in their sobbing voices <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“Libertate, Libertate!”</span> while
such as could master a word or two of French,
stammered in their soft lisping Pisan accent, an appeal
in the language of his distant country: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Liberté,
liberté, cher Sire!”</span> There was no affectation in
this outburst of enthusiasm, nay, almost of idolatry.
Any man who was stronger than Florence was a
possible hero to the Pisans. The great motley army
of Charles proved his force, and in the rugged
amiable faces of master and of men the Pisans
recognized the faculty of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Pisans had been to some extent prepared to find
this virtue in the French by the correspondence of the
Pisan exiles with Lodovico of Milan, whose trump-card
was to secure if possible the liberation of Pisa by the
French, and then, after their return to France, to offer
himself as protector to the abandoned city. This
plan was so well-contrived that, if only the first
impulse were given, the machine must go on of
itself; for the Pisans would certainly accept their
liberty, if the French could be moved to grant it
them; and, equally certainly, the French, after their
return to France, could not afford to hold Pisa
against not only Florence, but Milan, Venice, Genoa,
and Lucca, who would none of them submit to hand
a Mediterranean port to Charles. Lodovico was
convinced that the Pisans would prefer the untried
yoke of Milan to the hated bonds of Florence.
The great thing was to give the first impulse.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this end the Duke of Milan, when he had
quitted the French camp the previous Tuesday,
had left behind him Galeazzo di San Severino, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>brilliant young husband of his natural daughter.
Galeazzo had instructions to do his utmost in every
way to induce the French to protect the Pisans in a
rebellion against Florence. He did not waste so
excellent an opportunity. No sooner were Charles
and his nobles in the Medici palace and the uncouth
French soldiers housed like sons and brothers in the
homes of Pisa, than the adroit young San Severinesco
called a private council of the chief Pisan nobles. He
advised them, as a son of Milan, and as a friend and
well-wisher of their own, to throw themselves at once
and utterly upon the generosity of France. This was
a tempting counsel; yet there were some, and among
them the warlike Giulio della Rovere, Cardinal of
Saint Peter ad Vincula, that were for patience.
“What shall we do when France has left the city?”
they asked of one another. “Milan will protect
you!” cried Messer Galeazzo, with a burst of inspiring
confidence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Pisans hesitated only for a moment. From
Venice or from Milan they had always hoped to gain
their liberty at last, or at the least a change of
masters. France, backed by Milan, seemed the most
desirable deliverer: the ancient suzerain of the
city supported by its latest friend. It was difficult
at that moment to imagine a stronger conjunction in
Italy; for in 1494 Charles was spoken of as the
second Charlemagne, and no one ventured to set a
bound to the triumphs of Lodovico of Milan. “All
that he desires,” the Venetian secretary was writing
almost at this very time, “all that he desires, Fortune
has conceded him, and all his plans come true.” For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>France and Milan to protect Pisa against the rest of
Italy in 1494, was as if Russia and a stronger Servia
to-day were to join their forces to secure Bulgaria
against the anger of the other Balkan States.</p>

<p class='c006'>Venice for a brief moment had sunk into the
shade. She, who had manœuvred so deeply to unseat
Arragon and Sforza by the help of France, beheld,
to her immense chagrin, Charles VIII. following her
own suggestions as to the enterprise of Naples with
Lodovico Sforza as his mentor and ally. Milan had
taken the place of Venice in the French Council; Milan,
which the French should have conquered as their
earliest prey. “It is extraordinary how that man
succeeds,” wrote Marin Sanuto. “Yet it may chance
that he outwit himself at last. Please God, he come
to a good end! But I for one do not believe it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>At Pisa Lodovico registered a new success. It was
in vain that Vincula (for the first time in his life,
says Guicciardini, the author of quiet counsels) represented
to the assembled nobles the danger of the step.
They were beside themselves with the hope of liberty;
and indeed, all the French agree in telling us that
their condition was truly desperate. “Piteous, and
lamentable,” says Desrey, and Commines, a staunch
Florentine in principle, allows that they were
handled as cruelly as slaves. To men in such a
plight, and counselled by a person so important as
San Severino, no risk appears too great to run that
leaves a chance for liberty.</p>

<p class='c006'>And so that very night the Pisans, still in their
gala-dresses, but with torn hair, faces of mourning,
clasped hands and streaming eyes, thronged into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>council-chamber of the astonished King. “It was
lamentable,” writes an <a id='corr368.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='eye-witness,” to hear'>eye-witness, “to hear</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_368.2'><ins class='correction' title='eye-witness,” to hear'>eye-witness, “to hear</ins></a></span> them
tell the wrongs and grievances they endured.” It was
as if, in the middle of their gala, one of them, with
a significant irony, had raised the corner of the pale
silk gala-hangings and had revealed the mouldering
stone, the unsightly ruin underneath. As the Pisans
exposed the real degradation of their slavery, the
facile rash humanity of the French was touched to
tears; and when Messer Simone Orlandi (an accomplished
gentleman who could express himself in
French) had finished his recital, it was not only the
Pisans who, pale with indignation and with pity, turned
to the King of France on the throne seated of Medici,
and cried out to him, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Liberté, liberté, cher Sire!”</span></p>

<p class='c006'>At this point an accomplished Legist, a Counsellor
of the Parliament in Dauphiné, named Ribot, who
also was a Master of Requests at Court, turned to the
King and said: it was indeed a lamentable case, and
that never, for sure, were any other men so hardly
used as these. The King himself—touched to the
heart, as were all these frank and simple Frenchmen,
by the unsuspected misery beneath the gold brocades
of this fantastic Italy, and not quite understanding (as
Commines suggests) what it was the Pisans meant by
this word Liberty—answered vaguely that he would
be content they should enjoy it. This at least is the
mild version of Commines, who was absent in Venice
at the time; but Pierre Desrey, actually present at
the scene, puts a stronger warrant in the mouth of
Charles: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Il les assura de les conserver dans leurs
franchises.”</span></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>That night the Florentines in Pisa—men in office,
judges, merchants, and soldiers of the garrison—were
driven at the sword’s point out of the rebellious
city. The statue of Marzocco on the bridge was
hurled in a thousand pieces into the muddy Arno;
the standard of Florence was dragged and trampled
in the mire; and bonfires until morning hailed the
discomfiture of the King’s allies. On the morrow
after noon Charles left the city. He had placed a
garrison of three hundred French soldiers in the new
citadel; he had appointed three commissioners to
superintend affairs; but he had taken no steps to
impose the least restraint of civil order upon this
impassioned and suddenly enfranchised people. Fortunately
the nobles of the town took the matter into
their wiser hands. Twenty-four hours after the entry
of the French, Pisa was a free Republic governed by
a Gonfalonier, six Priors, and a Balia of Ten, with a
new militia of its own, and, for the first time in
eight and eighty years, a Pisan garrison in the
ancient citadel.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>III.</h3>

<p class='c016'>If we ask, What right had the King of France to set
at liberty the subjects of his allies, lent to him in his
need as a temporary gage? we find the question
difficult to answer. To statesmen like Commines or
Briçonnet there was something shocking and dishonourable
in the liberation of Pisa by the King,
something that the tenderest palliation for generous
youth and inexperience could not attempt to <a id='corr369.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='justify-'>justify.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_369.30'><ins class='correction' title='justify-'>justify.</ins></a></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>On the other hand, to fresh enthusiastic spirits, such
as Ligny or the King himself, there was a degree of
inhumanity in leaving the Pisans to their obvious
slavery which no code of political honour could extenuate.</p>

<p class='c006'>These two parties, and these two counsels, marched
with the King out of Pisa into Empoli, where he slept
that Monday night—doubtless in the same bad inn that
had so poorly housed the adventurous Medici just
fifteen nights ago. When, on the Tuesday, the King
arrived at Signa he heard that the city of Florence
was in revolt. Florence and Pisa, unknown to one
another, had each regained their liberty upon the
selfsame day. For when the King of France came in
sight of the group of domes and towers along the
Arno, his young guest at Sarzana, so recently the
lord of all this beauty, was escaping to Bologna
across the mountains in disguise with a price upon
his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>Charles, the pupil of the Duke of Milan, was not
well inclined to Florence; and he was not propitiated
by the fact that Piero de’ Medici had been expelled the
city on account of the great concessions he had made
to France at the time of his fugitive visit to Sarzana. A
month ago the King had declared that Piero alone was
his enemy, and that the city was his friend; since the
30th of October he had changed his mind it was the
pliant Medici who now appeared his friend, and his
anger was against rebellious Florence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet what had Florence done more audacious than
that which Charles himself had sanctioned in the
Pisans? Florence had expelled the Medici; Pisa the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>Florentines, almost at the selfsame hour. But the
fact that the Florentines condemned the loan of the
fortresses hardened the heart of the King, conscious
that by the liberation of the Pisans he had justified the
greatest of their fears. This was, in fact, the direst
harm with which an enemy could threaten Florence;
and Charles had done it despite his name of friend. It
was only natural that he should nourish a grievance
against the ally whom he had injured; and when on
the 17th of November the French entered Florence,
it was remarked that the King rode through the streets,
lance on thigh, with the bearing of an offended
conqueror. His mind was as haughty as his mien,
and he was prepared to claim from the Republic the
independence of Pisa and the restoration of Piero to
the chief place in the government.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the Florentines were no less resolute than
Charles. Capponi made his famous threat, and the
King, after ten days of vain parade of force, swore a
solemn treaty with the Florentines upon the 25th of
the month. By the terms of this convention it was
arranged that Pisa and Leghorn were to be left in the
hands of the King till his return from Naples, and
then given back to Florence; the King was to decide
between Genoa and Florence as to the final disposal
of Sarzana and Pietro Santa; the King was to say no
more till March concerning the restoration of the
Medici, when the Signory, if he desired, would reconsider
the matter, and meanwhile, by Royal request,
the price was taken off the tyrants’ heads, and the
wife and child of Piero were permitted to remain in
Florence. The Signory agreed to pay the King, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>three terms, the sum of 120,000 ducats towards the
expense of the campaign; but, for us, the most important
proviso of this treaty (which the student may
consult in the first volume of Desjardin’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Négociations”</span>)
is one that secured a complete amnesty for Pisa.
Moreover Florence promised, in favour of the King,
to rule that city in the future with a more liberal and
a gentler hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not three weeks since Charles had promised
to maintain the Pisans in their liberty, and those unhappy
patriots who could not penetrate (Commines declares
that no Italian ever could) the shifting confusion
of the Court, did not know, and would have little cared
to understand, that Beaucaire and Ligny had held the
balance yesterday, but Gannay, Gié, and Briçonnet
to-day. The only consolation that they could have
found in this unstability of favour was the chance that
their advocates might soon again succeed to power,
and as a fact they had made a great point in securing
the sympathy of Ligny (the King’s cousin) and
Piennes—two young gentlemen of the King’s own age
who were his inseparable companions, wore armour
like his own and the Royal colours. These two
gallants counted on their side the Seneschal of
Beaucaire, one of the King’s two especial counsellors.
But the other, Briçonnet, supported the Florentine
party. The elder and more diplomatic statesmen,
such as, Gié, Gannay, and Commines, were all on the
side of Florence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such was the position of the Court when, in the
January of 1495, the Pisans sent to Rome, as a last
desperate advocate of their extremity, a gentleman of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>their city, skilled in French, one Messer Burgundio
Legolo, or Lolo as the slurring Pisan voices gave the
name. The King received the ambassador graciously,
but in the presence of the Florentine envoys; and
the party of pity, and the party of honour (if so we
may name the factions of Ligny and of Briçonnet)
were both assembled when the Pisan advocate began
to address the King:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now for nearly ninety years,”<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c014'><sup>[130]</sup></a> began Burgundio
Lolo, “the city of Pisa, once the greatest in Italy,
once carrying her Empire into the recesses of the
East, has suffered the yoke of an intolerable servitude.
The cruel avarice of Florence has brought our city
into so great a depth of desolation that her streets
are almost empty of inhabitants, for the most of her
citizens, unable to endure this grinding slavery, have
gone into a voluntary exile abandoning their native
land. Those that remain, incapable of plucking from
their hearts the love of country, have indeed renounced
all else that renders life endurable. The acerb and
cruel exactions of foreign taxes, the insolent rapine
of private Florentines, the injustice that forbids us by
art or trade or public office to recruit our fallen
fortunes, have left us an empty life, plundered of all
enjoyment: nay, dangerous even and deadly, for
the clayey marshes that our ancestors kept with exact
and pious diligence, are now so little drained, so long
neglected that the waters of Maremma sap our fairest
palaces and our churches, our houses, our public
buildings fall into ruins while the miasma of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>stagnant waters breeds a grievous fever in our midst.
And where shall we turn to forget our misery and our
dishonour? we, who are denied an outlet to our energy
and our ambition? As we pass the void hours of our
leisure in the ruined streets of our once glorious city,
shall we not feel the pity of the ruin? shall we look
unmoved upon the dishonoured remnant of the magnificence
of our ancestors? Nay, since it is no shame
to Pisa, after a long renown to be fallen in decay—because
in all the eminence of this world there is inherent
this fatality of corruption—were it not wiser,
even for her conquerors, in musing on her ancient
greatness to turn their hearts to pity, rather than to
use so cruel an advantage over a city in whose decadence
they should, in truth, behold the inevitable
presage of their own?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Alas, so cruel, so insatiable, so impious has been
the Florentine dominion that, rather than return to
that slavery, we would forfeit life itself. And now at
last a hope—a dear hope of liberty—has dawned upon
us; and we beseech you, O King of France, with tears—not
only these few visible tears of mine, but, invisible
and ample, the lamentations of all the distant
city—here at your feet, O King, I beseech you to
remember what justice, what piety, what clemency of
a magnanimous prince would shine for ever round
your name should you choose to be the Father and
Deliverer of Pisa, rather than the Minister of the
slavery of Florence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a little silence. In these accents men
seemed to hear an echo of that natural law that lives
immutable behind the convenience of nations—νομὶμα
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>ἄγραπτα κᾶσφαλὴ θεῶν. The King’s face glowed; and
the enthusiasm of Ligny and Piennes was reflected in
the demeanour of Beaucaire, a rash and low-born
person moved by pity, moved by Pisan money also (if
we are to believe Guicciardini), moved certainly by
rivalry of Briçonnet. The other party waited somewhat
anxiously for the Florentine ambassador to
answer Lolo. Soderini, Bishop of Volterra, was a
practical and eminent statesman, but on that excited
audience his words fell without wings to reach their
hearts.</p>

<p class='c006'>Florence, he said, had bought Pisa with good
money. She had been kinder than she need have
been, for when the wilful Pisans yielded, half-dead
with famine, she had brought more victuals than firearms
to finish their subjection. She had the right to
use her chattel as she would, and had she been a
thousand times more harsh who should come between
a man and his own? It was ridiculous to prate of
the ancient grandeur of Pisa—God had made an end
of that long before the Florentines, and she had been
a poor bargain to Florence ever since the hour of her
purchase.</p>

<p class='c006'>So spoke the hard-headed Bishop of Volterra. But
even as reported by a Florentine historian these arguments
do not make any great effect; and it was quite
clear, as he avows, that the Pisan advocate had made
a far deeper impression on the King. And as, that
very week, Briçonnet was sent to Florence upon a
diplomatic mission, the party of Pisa remained triumphant
in the camp where with (Commines in Venice
and Briçonnet in Tuscany) Beaucaire and Ligny and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>Piennes held for the moment the whole of Royal
favour.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Louis de Ligny-Luxembourg, Grand Chamberlain of
France, cousin of the King through his Savoyard
mother, was the son of that unfortunate Comte de
St. Pol decapitated by Louis XI. He was not only
one of the great nobles of France, but one of the
first gentlemen in Europe, for his house was ancient
and illustrious by descent and especially fortunate in
marriage. Nevertheless the young man was poor;
yet owing to his charming manners, his courage and
adroitness, he was a most important factor not only
in the Court of the King but in the Court of Orleans.
The Count of Ligny, chivalrous, amorous, and pitiful,
flits, for a brief moment, like the figure of Youth in
an allegory—across the serious stage of the Italian
wars; and his tragic childhood and his melancholy
marriage seem to throw out with a brighter lustre the
intrinsic brilliance of that scintillating presence.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was, say the French chroniclers, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“prince gentil
vaillant, adroit et généreux,”</span> a pattern for nobles and
the beloved of ladies. Guicciardini, looking from
another point of view, calls him juvenile, inexperienced,
and light. To quote a final authority, Commines
briefly gives the reason for our dwelling on him:
“Above all others,” says he, “this young gentleman
especially favoured the Pisans’ cause.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ligny had ever been a politician of Orleans’ party,
that earlier faction so long stimulated by intriguing
Venice, which aimed not only at the conquest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>Naples, but also at securing Milan. With these two
great possessions at either end of Italy, it was clear
that Pisa would make an excellent half-way house.
Pity for the Pisans was probably the essential motor
of Ligny’s action, yet there is no doubt he desired to
further the policy of Orleans. And before the winter
was over, Ligny’s marriage gave him a personal
interest in the game.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the early spring of 1495, Charles VIII. had
arrived in Naples. With that fatal lack of policy
which was destined to frustrate a more than mortal
triumph, he began to lavish the possessions of the
Neapolitan aristocracy upon his favourites and
countrymen. A wiser King would have conciliated
the native barons and wedded their interest to his
own, so that when he came to leave the country he
should leave behind him a whole nobility of viceroys.
But Charles only thought of rewarding his favourites
of the hour. The daughter of the Prince of Altamura,
the last of her house, the heiress of immense possessions,
was reserved for Ligny.</p>

<p class='c006'>Madonna Lionora was a young princess of more than
common interest, the last Altamura in the direct line,
the last of that race which claimed to be descended
from the Three Kings of the East. It was easy to make
the Count of Ligny virtually the Prince of Altamura
by marrying him to this young girl. This was done,
but Ligny was barely seven days the bridegroom of
his lovely Mage when the King, alarmed at the preparations
of the League, determined to march northwards.
Ligny of course went with him, leaving his
bride behind him in a convent. And on the long road
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>northwards the desire to be near his young wife and
his new possessions gave a keener zest to the scheme
of a Central Italian French dependency of which
Ligny himself should be made the governor. When
the army reached Siena, though the city was a fief of
the Holy Roman Empire, and therefore implicated in
the Anti-Gallic league, none the less the Republic
declared for France, demanding Ligny for her
governor. The young man left a garrison there under
Gaucher de Tinteville, and went with the King, hoping
to pursue a like policy in Pisa.</p>

<p class='c006'>The King had not yet decided whether he would
halt in Pisa or in Florence. On the eve of Corpus
Christi, Wednesday, the 17th of June, the French
reached Poggibonsi where the roads divide. Here
they halted for a day to keep the festival, and here the
King was met by no less a personage than Savonarola,
accompanied by fifty notables of Florence. This
at the moment must have appeared terribly against
the plans of Ligny, for if there was a man in Italy
whom the French regarded with a curious, half-superstitious
respect, it was this authoritative friar, with the
harsh sweetness in his voice, the saturnine head, the
asper and loving expression in his painful smile, who,
as one authorized of heaven, had foretold their advent
before they were persuaded to the step.</p>

<p class='c006'>Poggibonsi, as I have said, is the last considerable
town before the ways divide that lead to Pisa and to
Florence. At such a cross-road was also the mind of
Charles. Which turning should he take? “Keep
your vows, restore the cities, respect Florence, lest ye
incur the awful judgment of God, whose name, unless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>ye keep your oath, ye took in vain upon the altar of
St. John in Florence!” So thundered Savonarola;
and there were many things in favour of this plan;
firstly, the strong personal influence of the prophetic
Ferrarese; secondly, the fact that Charles was sore
in need of ready money, and hoped to borrow it in
Florence; thirdly, at Poggibonsi he had heard that war
was begun, that Orleans was in Novara, and, therefore,
he himself and his handful of troops in desperate need
of the Florentine army. A little persuasion and no
doubt the King would have gone to Florence; but
Savonarola scorned to persuade, he menaced. The
city, he said, was armed to the teeth; she would receive
the King rather as a prodigal than a conqueror.
If he wished to conciliate her, let him keep his word;
then, but only then, she would shower her benefits
upon the elect of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>This accent was not so moving to the King as the
entreaties of Burgundio Lolo. Pisa, as Charles knew
very well, would receive him as a hero and a deliverer—but
Pisa had neither men nor money.</p>

<p class='c006'>In these uncertainties two days went by; the King
alternately assuring Savonarola that he would keep his
word to Florence, and protesting that he had not the
heart to break that earlier promise given to the Pisans.
Out of this hobble there was no way except by broken
vows and treachery. It was a delicate question for a
chivalrous prince, nourished, like Charles, on Amadis
and Arthur: for to keep faith with the Pisans would
be to ruin his ally; and to keep faith with Florence
to hand over to slavery a people who had solemnly
placed themselves under his protection. Nor were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>the political advantages quite easy to decide.
Florence, of course, offered men and money sorely
needed; but Pisa offered an asylum in case of reverses
further north, or in case the Florentines should
prove as faithless as the rest of the Italians. For
Pisa was not merely a friendly city, but a city actually
in the hands of France. This was certainly an argument—“nevertheless,”
says Guicciardini, “I doubt if
anything so logical could influence the King. Much
more potent with such as he were the tears, and
entreaties of the Pisans.” Those tears, invisible and
ample as the waters of life, Burgundio Lolo had quoted
to the King at Rome; and after all these months the
memory of the Pisan advocate pleaded successfully
against the actual influence of Savonarola.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last a straw decided the unsteady balance. At
a village called Campana, or Cassino, near to Florence,
the King heard of a cruel raid committed by the
Florentines upon the Pisan town of Pontevalle.
There had been French soldiers in the fort; but when
the French archers came up to the rescue they found
the little place untenanted save by dying men,
wheeling birds of prey, and corpses. The King was
furious against the Florentines; yet it was with the
lightness of heart that follows the taking of a difficult
decision that he set his back against the town, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“et
gaiement s’en alla dedans Pise.”</span></p>

<h3 class='c015'>V.</h3>

<p class='c016'>History is not decided by oratory. The eloquence of
Lolo, the menaces of the Friar, had conspired with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>momentary distress and anger, to lodge the French
in Pisa. It still remained to see what Charles would
do. The first move promised little; in order to guard
against a second surrender to the impulse of the
moment Charles sent a messenger to Florence, and
promised to speak the final word, only when he should
have arrived in Lucca.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if history is in fact decided by Necessity—that
grim and resolute Anankê who cuts the most different
characters to her pattern, making of a Louis XI.,
and a Henry V., so individual as princes, no more, when
once the coronation day is over, than able continuers
of the policy she imposes; if Necessity and the slow
evolution of ideas control the individual, and leave
him scarce more independent than the nail, which
moves indeed, but only moves to follow the control of
the attracting magnet; yet it is not merely by the
unbroken sequence of Law that the world progresses.
Comets and cataclysms, plagues and earthquakes,
and in the moral world, sudden, fierce contagions of
enthusiasm or ecstasy interrupt and modify their
course.</p>

<p class='c006'>Driven by a momentary resentment, a gust of pity
and remembrance, into Pisa, Charles was no sooner
in the city than the King resumed his empire over
the Man. He sent, as I have said, an embassy to
Florence, reassuring as best he could the potent and
wealthy city, putting off his answer, and asking
meanwhile for an instalment of money and three
hundred lances. The Florentines sent no money and
only eighty lances, and Charles perceived that the
least extra strain would break the slender thread that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>still bound her to the French. Henceforth he steeled
his royal heart against impolitic pity. It was in vain
that he looked on the statue of himself upon the
bridge, embellished in sculpture, resolute, heroic,
Saviour of the City, trampling underfoot the Lion of
Florence and the Viper of Milan. It was in vain,
that, at the entrance of the army, the little children
of Pisa dressed in white satin sown with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>fleur-de-lis</em></span>
rushed to the gates to meet the soldiers, crying in
their high, sweet, confident voices, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Viva Francia!”</span>
It was in vain that, in the early morning, as the King
returned from the intenerating Sacrament of the
Mass, he met in the streets the fairest ladies of the
town, barefoot, dishevelled, dressed like slaves in
coarse mourning garments, who dropped before him
on their knees, sighing and wailing for liberty.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most that Charles could do was to defer, to
temporize, to vacillate; he could not be brought to
pledge himself to more. He, with a remnant of his
army, was alone in an inimical country, subject at
any moment to encounter the forces of Venice, Milan,
Spain, the Emperor and the Pope; meanwhile
Florence was his one efficient friend. Florence to
him had been a leal and honest ally; dare he desert
her? ought he to repay her sacrifice with ruin? And
yet this faithful Florence had behaved to Pisa in a
fashion cruel and anti-human beyond words. And
Pisa also had trusted him; Pisa was tenderly his
friend. Could he fling the wounded hare which had
taken refuge under his royal mantle to the fierce eyes
and gaping jaws of the hound which served him?</p>

<p class='c006'>The question wrung the conscience of the man.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>But, for the King, the matter was easily decided. His
first duty was to his country and his troops; Florence
could help him to reach the forces of Orleans in safety
and with some degree of glory; but Pisa could furnish
no active aid at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile, the army had become fired with
entirely different convictions. Suddenly King
Charles, the adored conqueror, the second Charlemagne,
the unlettered and ugly little captain whose
soldiers’ devotion so amazed the Milanese, beheld
himself in the midst of his troops almost without
authority. The army, like one man, rose and spoke
on behalf of the Pisans.</p>

<p class='c006'>Insulated in this shelter of Pisa, with the offended
Florentines continually harassing his outposts, with
in front the fastnesses of the Apennines, and (God
alone knew where) the five-toothed Trap of the
League into which his little force must fall—in this
terrible complication Charles beheld himself menaced
by no less than the mutiny of his own army. And
for what? Not on account of the light head and imprudent
heart that had brought this handful of
soldiers to fight such fearful odds. This rebellion
was inspired purely by the pity inspired by men
whose situation was certainly less hazardous than
the peril of their indignant champions.</p>

<p class='c006'>But all day long the army surged in front of the
palace clamouring “Liberty! liberty!” in more
virile voices than the Pisans’. The army infected
the Court; and one day, when the King sat playing
draughts alone with M. de Piennes, forty or fifty
gentlemen of the Royal household with their partisans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>forced their way into his chamber and declaimed the
woes of Pisa. Charles was indignant, and spoke so
roughly, that they took their persuasions and menaces
elsewhere. Even the poor archers, says Commines,
moved by pity for the tears and lamentations of the
Pisans, threatened those whom they believed persuaded
the King to keep his oath at Florence. A
private archer menaced Briçonnet; others used rude
language to Marshal de Gié; and for three nights
President Gannay durst not sleep in his lodgings.
The Frenchmen infected the Swiss; and these ferocious
giants, who a few days later should massacre
man, woman, and child at Pontremoli, proved themselves
as passionate in their apology for liberty. “Do
you want money?” cried young Sallezart their paymaster.
“Is it mere money that leads you to this
infamy? Take rather our collars, our buckles, and our
silver ornaments; stop our wages and spend the sum
of our arrears. We will pay you as well as Florence!
only set the Pisans free!”</p>

<p class='c006'>In front of such enthusiasm Charles dared not
avow a contrary decision. It was in vain that
Briçonnet and his party urged instant fidelity to
Florence. It was useless for Commines to observe
that keeping faith with Florence did not preclude a
sentiment of tenderest concern for Pisa, though after
all, as the excellent diplomat observed, “Divers cities
in Italy that be in subjection are as evil-entreated as
she”—<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Sie ist nicht die Erste</em></span>. Charles would promise
nothing to Pisa, nothing definite; but also he would
make no vows to Florence. He knew that the task
before his little army was of the sternest and of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>severest, physically impossible to discouraged and
disaffected troops. Therefore he wrote to the Florentines
saying that he would give his answer, not at
Lucca, but at Asti; and while, in his heart, as we
shall see, he meant to make the best of terms for
Pisa, and then restore her to the Florentines, he
left for the nonce, a French garrison in the city,
three hundred picked men, difficultly spared, under
the governorship of Robert de Balzac Seigneur
d’Entragues. Thus, by a judicious temporizing,
Charles hoped to untie the Gordian knot. By turning
his back on the difficulty he thought he had
suppressed it. And yet, were these three hundred
men left behind in Pisa, likely to become more obedient
to an absent monarch? Was Entragues, a man of
Orleans’ household, Ligny’s candidate, likely to carry
out the views of Commines or of Briçonnet against
the avowed policy of his master and his patron?
Charles, it may be supposed, did not ask himself
these questions. He bestowed on Entragues, not
merely the governorship of Pisa, but the command of
the frontier castles, and, without further hesitation,
left the town.</p>

<p class='c006'>Robert de Balzac, Seigneur d’Entragues, was, says
Commines, a very ill-conditioned fellow. But a similar
opinion has been entertained by many historians for
the most successful of their political opponents.
Robert de Balzac was the son of Jean d’Entragues
and his wife the sister of the famous Comte de
Dammartin. Robert was a very young man when the
accession of Louis XI. brought about the disgrace
and exile of his all-powerful uncle. Every student of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>history is familiar with the legend of that great disgrace:
how the estates of the unhappy minister were
divided among the favourites at Court; how his wife
with her suckling child was left destitute and hunted
out of all her castles; how forsaken by all her friends,
she wandered like an excommunicated woman along
the lanes of Dammartin begging for her bread, until a
poor day-labourer, Anthoine Le Fort, took the abandoned
Countess to his hovel and sheltered her and her
baby, eighteen months old, the starving little godson
of the Duke of Bourbon. Jeanne was still in the
peasant’s hut; her husband had fled for his life to
Germany; when, as a last effort, Robert de Balzac,
the Count’s nephew, was sent to Court to plead his
cause. It was no light task to undertake. Men had
been banished or odiously imprisoned for entreating
the pardon of Dammartin, and many well-meaning
friends would have dissuaded the young man.
But he went his way, arriving at Court about the
end of 1466, and pleaded so well that, after several
audiences, the King recalled his uncle and placed
him high in favour.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such was the man—about forty years of age,
rhetorical, impulsive, brave, generous, and audacious
whom the King had left in command at Pisa.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VI.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The little army of Charles, dragging its artillery
with lacerated hands across the Apennines, cutting
its way through the Venetian forces at Fornovo,
arrived at last in Asti; and, when August came, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>prospect of peace began to brighten before them.
The King had come to terms with Florence; and—granted
the inevitable treachery of the situation—the
Treaty of Turin was not unkind. It is true that the
King agreed to restore the city of Pisa, with the
other Tuscan fortresses, to his ally of Florence; but
on the express proviso of not merely an amnesty for
the Pisans. Henceforth they were to trade by sea and
land on equal terms with Florence, they were to enjoy
the same civil rights, their ancient arts of navigation
and ship-building were to be released from embargo,
and their sequestered property was to be given back
to their possession. Charles had put his muzzle on
the hound; Pisa, though restored to her immemorial
energy, should henceforth be protected by the chief
ally of Florence.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was, in fact, a comparative equality that Charles
proposed. Still remaining an intrinsic part of the
Florentine territory, as indeed the safety and prosperity
of that Republic demanded, henceforth the
admirable commercial situation of Pisa was not to be
turned merely to a Florentine profit, nor were the
Pisans to be entirely governed for Florentine ends
and by a Florentine Council. In their government
henceforth the Pisans themselves should have a place
and a right; and the only exclusive advantage which
the Florentines should retain would be that superior
dignity, that reserve of power, with which a powerful
mother-country inevitably controls her colonies and
her dependencies. Henceforth in law, in all that can
be assessed by franchise and by jurisdiction, the
Pisans should stand on an equal footing with the
Florentines.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>This decided, Charles, satisfied he had been unfair
to nobody, on August 16th, wrote from Turin a
letter to Entragues, signed with his own signature
and countersigned by Orange, Vincula, Briçonnet, <a id='corr388.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Gie'>Gié</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_388.4'><ins class='correction' title='Gie'>Gié</ins></a></span>,
De la Trémouille, Commines, and (somewhat to our
surprise) Piennes. This list of names is eloquent of
the triumph of the diplomatic party; Ligny is not
there, nor D’Amboise nor Étienne de Beaucaire,
though these were among the nearest of the Royal
counsellors. It was, in fact, necessary that something
should be done at once. Orleans and his men
were still starving in beleaguered Novara; Montpensier
and the army were fighting at desperate odds
in Naples. Peace with Florence would immediately
place in the hands of the King 70,000 ducats and 250
men-at-arms;<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c014'><sup>[131]</sup></a> besides releasing the soldiers in Pisa,
Murrone, Leghorn, Sarzana, Pietra Santa, and Librafatta,
who with the Florentine contingent would be
an efficient succour to Montpensier. But Florence
would not pay the money until the fortresses were
in her hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>The King’s letter to Entragues arrived in Pisa on
the 29th of August. “You may feel,” the letter ran,<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c014'><sup>[132]</sup></a>
“<em>on account of your oath</em>, a certain difficulty in placing
the new Citadel of Pisa in other hands than ours, but
we absolve and discharge you of that oath, and command
you, so soon as you receive this letter, incontinent
to deliver the said Citadel of Pisa into the
hand of the Commissioners of Florence, provided that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>one or any of our Councillors assure you that the
Government of Florence have accorded and agreed to
our Articles.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“A cause du serment que vous avez fait, vous
pourriez différer de ne mettre la dicte Citadelle neufve
de Pise en aultres mains que les nostres.”</span> This
phrase conveys the suggestion that on leaving Pisa,
Charles had promised a permanent French protection
to the city. At least it seems clear that Entragues
had sworn to yield his position only to the French.</p>

<p class='c006'>These three months Entragues and his men had
lived as the saviours of Pisa with the Pisans, feted by
the citizens, lodged not only in the citadel but in the
palace of the Medici upon Lung’ Arno; no longer an
insignificant portion of the motley hosts of France,
but the beloved guests and masters of this exquisite
Southern city. They had the advantage of the port
from which to ship a succour to or from the armies
in the South; they enjoyed the great pine-woods
of the sea, full of game for hunting; they had
grown to love the wide, soft views of fertile plains
bounded by a dim line of blue mountains where their
comrades held the frontier castles. The position of
the French in Pisa was not only felicitous, but strong;
and they were required to abandon it into the hands
of the Florentines, allies, it is true, of their king, but
to them desperate and deadly enemies with whom,
in defiance of the truce, they had continually waged
an aggravated and embittering guerilla war of raids
and plunder. And these three months, which had
increased the original suspicion and dislike which the
French army entertained of Florence, had been spent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>in befriending and helping the Pisans, for whom even
at the first they had felt so divine a rage of pity, and
whom they were now commanded to betray. Most of
the men had probably made relations in the town.
Entragues as we know from Guicciardini, was much
in love with, and probably deeply influenced by, the
daughter of Messer Luca del Lante; and a little later
he married either this or some other Pisan lady, for
Marin Sanuto speaks of San Cassano, the Pisan
Ambassador at Venice, as <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“el cugnato d’Andrages.”</span>
Thus passion, no less than resentment, and the sense
of well-being as well as compassion bound Entragues
to Pisa. Add to this, incredible as it may seem, the
sentiment of loyalty; for long as was the reign of
Louis XI., it had not been long enough to extirpate
the feudal idea, and Entragues, although the subject
of the King, felt himself in a far more intimate degree
the vassal of Orleans, and the lieutenant of Ligny.
Now, as I have said, the names of Orleans and Ligny
are conspicuously absent from the signatures below
the letter of the King. To yield Pisa would have
been to reverse their policy; and it is possible (to
Commines, Guicciardini, Giulini, Porto Venere, and
other contemporaries, it appeared quite certain) that
Orleans or Ligny wrote to Entragues, and bade him
resist the decision of the King. This much at least
is sure: <em>Entragues refused to yield the fortresses</em>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Vainly the King reiterated his urgent letters—imploring
letters, still preserved in the Florence
Archives under the dates of the 29th and 31st of
August, the 25th of September, the 1st and 22nd
of October—letters, beseeching, commanding the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>evacuation of the garrisons, but all in vain. Not
only Pisa, but Sarzana, Pietra Santa, Librafatta,
and Murrone, obstinately held out against the royal
mandate; only the Governor of Leghorn, on the
17th of September, yielded to the entreaties of his
sovereign. Meanwhile in Naples, in Gaeta, Taranto,
and Atella, in all the desolate villages of the wild
Abbruzzi, the famished and abandoned army looked
northwards, in vain, day after day across the mountains.
Winter began to whistle shrilly across the
windy hills; blue mists and subtle fevers rose out of
the marshy valleys; corn failed, and a cruel famine
began to devastate the land; and still the promised
reinforcements never came. Of that gallant army
nearly every soldier should perish by hunger, shipwreck,
or malaria; for the troops that were to bring
them a succour out of Tuscany never left the cities
where they dwelt.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 18th of September, Entragues drew up a
formal treaty with the Signory of Pisa. If in three
months the King did not re-enter Tuscany, he bound
himself to evacuate the citadel, and leave it in the
hands of Pisa. Meanwhile they were to supply him
every month with the two thousand ducats necessary
to pay and provision the garrison; and on his abandonment
of the fortress they were to purchase his
artillery and to give him the sum of 20,000 (or as
Sanuto has it, 30,000) ducats for himself. These
terms were not excessive: the Florentines a few
years ago had cheerfully paid 150,000 ducats as the
price of Pietro Santa, a less important place. It was,
however, as much as Pisa could pay: and to raise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>the sum the ladies of Pisa cheerfully sold the brightest
of their jewels. And the Pisans in their gratitude
for the staunchness and moderation of Entragues
awarded him a large estate, newly confiscated from
the Florentines, and a palace in the city. “It cannot
be for money that he did it,” remarks Guicciardini,
“for certainly the Florentines would have
given him twice as much.” It was probably out of
friendship and pity, out of a genuine enthusiasm,
out of an antiquated sentiment of feudal devotion,
combined with a desire to make a profit, that
Entragues committed this fatal and disastrous error.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VII.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The Florentines were indeed in a peculiarly evil
case; for Charles, who was their ally, found himself
powerless to procure them the restitution of Pisa;
and the Italian cities were resolved that, at no risk,
must Pisa pass to the ally of Charles. That post, in
the hands of the friends of France, would mean not
merely a door always open from Marseilles into
Tuscany, but a continual supply of help to the French
garrisons in Naples. It was certain that Pisa must
be kept, yet Pisa was too weak to stand alone; plot
and counter-plot darkened the decision as to which
great State the port of Pisa should belong.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the 16th of September to the 14th of
December, Captain Fracassa, the Duke of Milan’s
captain, held the town, dogged by the jealous surveillance
of a Venetian commissary, while Entragues
and his Frenchmen shut themselves inside the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>citadel. A few months later the Sienese, Lucchese,
and Genoese, united in a secret league with Pisa
against the Florentines. Milan and Venice wove a
ceaseless web of intrigue around the place. And it is
quite possible that by persisting in the citadel,
Entragues may have been animated by a lofty and
heroic disobedience, hoping by his presence to maintain
Pisa in fidelity to France, and to prevent it from
strengthening the hands of the deadly enemies of
his country.</p>

<p class='c006'>Be this as it may, on the 1st of January, Entragues,
having some days ago assisted at the expulsion of
Fracassa, placed the citadel in the hands of the Pisan
Signory. Great was the joy. Before the falling of
the night, the hated fortress, built by the Florentines
to dominate the town, was a shapeless heap of ruins.
New money was struck, bearing the head of Charles
VIII.; and salvo on salvo of artillery rang right
across the plain to the very walls of Florence,
announcing with a threat the dawn of the New Year,
which had begun with liberty in Pisa.</p>

<p class='c006'>Entragues himself, rich in the price of the gems
of Pisan beauty, retired for a month or two to Lucca,
to conclude his traffic on the fortresses. Pietra Santa
he sold to Lucca, Sarzana to Genoa. He did a good
turn to Pisa, distributing them, for a round sum, among
her allies. But if he hoped that Pisa would maintain
her independence by the protection of these humbler
friends he must easily have been deceived: it was no
later than the 26th of January when Messer Gianbernardin
del Agnolo was sent to Venice with a humble
message, entreating the august protection of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>city for the young Republic. It was Venice, rather
than Milan, to whom the Pisans turned—Venice preponderate
now in the Peninsula, sheltering in secret
Pisa and Taranto under her wide-reaching ægis.
During thirteen years from this date the shifting
fortunes, the greeds and jealousies of the great
Italian cities, fostered an artificial liberty in Pisa.
Thrown like a ball from Milan to Venice, Venice to
Maximilian, Max again to Venice, and thence to
Cæsar Borgia, the unhappy Republic described the
whole circle of desperate hope, agonized courage,
misery, poverty, cunning, and betrayal. But with
the anguish of her heroic vicissitudes we have, at this
moment, no concern. The conduct of Entragues is
our affair.</p>

<p class='c006'>From that New Year’s Day all hope was over for
the French in Naples. Gaeta, Taranto, Atella, Ostia
fell; Montpensier died of heartbreak, the troops of
fever; the great Guelf kingdom, the vision of so
many centuries, disappeared like fairy gold as soon as
the French had grasped it.</p>

<p class='c006'>In France, the Count of Ligny, Entragues’ patron,
was banished from the Court in disgrace. “He is
gone to his estates in Picardy,” wrote Antonio Vincivera,
“like a desperate creature. The King has
disgraced him because of the affair of Pisa.” Thus
Entragues, in the most effectual manner, had ruined
his master’s chances: and though in time Ligny was
pardoned by the King, it was not in the lifetime of
his bride. In February, 1498, the daughter of the
Mages expired, far from the arms of Ligny, in her
Nunnery at Naples.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>But if the action of Entragues proved unfortunate
to his friends, it had a more deadly consequence
to his enemies in Florence. The party of Savonarola
never recovered that failure of the French to give
back Pisa. For some time, amid famine, pestilence,
and ruin, they kept a weakening hold upon the city:
“And still they stand in hope of the things above,”
mocks Maron Sanuto, in the spring of 1497, “and
still they expect the coming of the King.” A year
later, in the May of 1498, Savonarola expiated that
delusion by the flaming penance of the stake.
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“Questa è la fine dei cattivi!”</span> ejaculates the
Venetian Secretary.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of all the actors in this complicated drama, the
one person who suffered not at all was that dishonoured
liberator, Entragues himself. He went
back to live in Pisa where he seems to have displayed
an eminent and almost official dignity. Twice
in moments of difficulty it was proposed that
Entragues should be sent as envoy to Venice, in place
of his brother-in-law; but the necessity passed away.
He remained in comfort and splendour in Pisa, where
we read of his receiving the Lucchese ambassadors
and conducting the diplomacy of the Republic. Pisa
herself—unhappy devotee of liberty!—grew poorer
and ever poorer, a humble pensioner on Venetian
bounty: “They adore us,” remarks Sanuto with some
fatuity, “and, of a verity, they would starve without
us.” But, shorn of all her territories as she was,
Pisa housed her liberator in a palace, and little
did it matter to this voluntary exile that his King
declared a readiness to decapitate him with royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>hands. Meanwhile he remained the natural centre of
all dignity in Pisa. Here we catch a last glimpse of
him in that sinister spring of 1498 which witnessed
in Florence the martyrdom of Savonarola and in
France the sudden death of Charles VIII. The
whirlwind that destroyed these mighty vessels allowed
the idle straw to float unharmed. “Entragues is
back in Pisa,” writes Sanuto, “which city is very
poor now, having lost all her lands and subsisting
only on that which we afford her. He has returned
some time from his visit to Jerusalem. He lives with
certain families in Pisa. He has money of his own,
and gives himself his pleasures.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Five years later, when the eminence of Venice was
dangerously threatened by Italian jealousy, the
Pisans began to look about for a new Protector. “We
will offer ourselves to the Devil,” they declared,
“rather than to Florence.” As a matter of fact they
offered themselves to Cæsar Borgia. They made very
few conditions: two of them are noteworthy in view
of the present history:</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Pisans will bestow themselves upon Il
Valentino if neither he nor the Pope will ever make
peace or truce with Florence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The new Duke must promise the city never to
make any peace or league with France.”</p>

<hr class='c017' />
<div class='footnote' id='f118'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r118'>118</a>. On October 30, 1403, he wrote to Florence and offered to
take one of the finest cities of the Milanese between Milan and
Piedmont if Florence would afford him (as indeed she offered
to do) an aid of 200 lances (Florence Archives, Filza II. dei
Dieci 3). Nothing appears to have come of this arrangement,
which appears to have been quite uncountenanced by the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>The footnotes are moved to follow the paragraph within which they are
referenced, and are sequenced numerically for uniqueness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hyphenation of compound words can be variable. Where it occurs on a line
break, the most commonly used form is assumed. Many footnotes contain
extended transcriptions in 14th or 15th century Italian, and it is
difficult to ascertain their correctness. With a few exceptions, noted below,
the text is printed verbatim.</p>

<p class='c006'>The name of the Convent of ‘Roderdesdorf’ in the Contents is everywhere
given in the text as ‘Rodardesdorf’. The Contents’ entry has been corrected
to facilitate searches.</p>

<p class='c006'>The page references in the Contents direct the reader to the indicated
topics. Be forewarned, however, that those references to the chapter on
‘The French at Pisa’ go astray after p. 354, and one entry is missing
entirely, but is most likely referring to p. 358.</p>

<p class='c006'>Obvious printer’s errors or printing flaws have been corrected, and
are noted here with their resolutions. The corrections are indicated
by page and line number, or, where the correction is to a note, by note
and line number within the note.</p>

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
